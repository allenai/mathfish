Problem: ""The Community Garden""

The community garden in your neighborhood is a beautiful place where people come together to grow their own fruits and vegetables. The garden has three sections: one for vegetables, one for fruits, and one for herbs. The gardeners have been working hard to make sure each section is healthy and thriving.

Recently, the gardeners noticed that some of the plants are not doing well. They decided to divide the plants into three groups: those that need more water, those that need more sunlight, and those that need more fertilizer. They want to make sure that each group gets the right amount of resources.

The gardeners have 20 buckets of water, 15 hours of sunlight, and 10 bags of fertilizer to distribute among the three groups. They want to divide these resources equally among the groups, so that each group gets the same amount of resources.

Your task is to help the gardeners by solving the following word problem:

What is the maximum number of plants that each group can have, if they want to divide the resources equally among the three groups?

In this problem, students must use objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem. They must also conceptually understand that the total amount of resources (20 buckets of water, 15 hours of sunlight, and 10 bags of fertilizer) is less than or equal to 20, which is the sum of the three whole numbers they will use to solve the problem.

To make this problem engaging and culturally responsive, you can encourage students to think about their own experiences with community gardens or shared resources. You can also ask them to consider how the gardeners' efforts to distribute resources equally reflects the values of fairness and cooperation.

Additionally, you can provide students with different ways to represent the problem, such as using visual aids like blocks or a hundreds chart, or creating equations that represent the distribution of resources. This will help students understand the problem from different perspectives and make connections between the abstract symbols and the real-world context.","Can you create a problem aligned to 1.OA.A.2 that requires students conceptually understand this standard?

Problem:

Sarah has 45 marbles in her pocket, and her friend Emily has 67 marbles in her pocket. Who has more marbles?

A) Sarah has more marbles.
B) Emily has more marbles.
C) They have the same number of marbles.

Simplification for Diverse Learners:

1. First, let's break down the numbers into tens and ones.
        * 45 = 40 + 5
        * 67 = 60 + 7
2. Now, let's compare the tens digits.
        * 40 > 60
3. Now, let's compare the ones digits.
        * 5 < 7
4. Since the tens digit of 45 is smaller than the tens digit of 67, and the ones digit of 45 is smaller than the ones digit of 67, we can say that 45 is less than 67.

Answer: B) Emily has more marbles.

Visual Aid:

Problem: Sarah has 14 pencils in her pencil case. She gives 4 pencils to her friend Emily. How many pencils does Sarah have left?

To simplify this problem for diverse learners, you can provide various strategies to help them solve it:

1. Counting On: Encourage students to start with the number of pencils Sarah has (14) and count on 4 more to find the total number of pencils Emily has. Then, subtract 4 from 14 to find out how many pencils Sarah has left.
2. Making Ten: Decompose 14 into 10 + 4. Then, subtract 4 from 10 to find out how many pencils Sarah has left.
3. Decomposing a Number Leading to a Ten: Decompose 14 into 13 + 1. Then, subtract 4 from 13 to find out how many pencils Sarah has left.
4. Relationship Between Addition and Subtraction: Use the fact that 8 + 4 = 12. Since Sarah has 14 pencils, she has 12 + 2 = 14 pencils left after giving 4 to Emily.
5. Creating Equivalent but Easier or Known Sums: Encourage students to break down the problem into simpler addition and subtraction problems. For example, they can add 6 + 7 by creating the known equivalent 6 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13. Then, they can subtract 4 from 13 to find out how many pencils Sarah has left.

The question mark represents the number of marbles that Chris has. We don't know this number yet, so we need to find it.

Can you help us solve the mystery by finding the missing number?

* What do we know about the total number of marbles?
* What do we know about the number of marbles that Alex and Ben have?
* What do we need to find out?
* How can we use the equation to find the missing number?

Samantha is a special education resource student who is working on her shapes and geometry skills. She has been tasked with creating a new toy for her classroom's pet rabbit, Mr. Fluffers. Samantha has a variety of shapes and materials available to her, including rectangles, squares, triangles, half-circles, quarter-circles, cubes, right rectangular prisms, right circular cones, and right circular cylinders.

Samantha wants to create a toy that will challenge Mr. Fluffers and keep him entertained. She decides to create a composite shape by combining several shapes together. She starts by gluing a square and a rectangle together to form a base. Then, she attaches a triangle to one side of the base to create a ramp. Next, she attaches a quarter-circle to the top of the ramp to create a curved surface. Finally, she attaches a small cube to the top of the curved surface to create a little hiding place for Mr. Fluffers.

Samantha is pleased with her creation, but she wants to take it a step further. She decides to compose new shapes from the composite shape she created. She starts by tracing the outline of the shape on a piece of paper. Then, she cuts out the shape and folds it in half to create a symmetrical shape. She then cuts out two small circles and attaches them to the top of the shape to create a pair of ears. Finally, she attaches a small triangle to the front of the shape to create a nose.

Samantha is thrilled with her new creation, which she has named ""Mr. Fluffers' Funhouse."" She presents it to her class and explains how she used geometry and composition to create a unique and challenging toy for their pet rabbit.

**Objective:** To help you understand how different shapes can fit together to make new shapes.

**Materials Needed:**  
- Paper  
- Crayons or colored pencils  
- Scissors  
- Glue stick   

**Shapes Provided:**  
Several copies of paper shapes including squares, rectangles, triangles, and half-circles. You can color them any way you like!

**Instructions:**

1. **Coloring**: Start by coloring each shape using your crayons or colored pencils. You might choose to color all squares one color, all rectangles another color, and so on. Or you can make each one unique!

2. **Cutting Out**: Carefully cut out each colored shape with your scissors. If you need help, ask your teacher or a friend.

3. **Planning Your Park**: Think about how you can put these shapes together to make a picture of a park. Can you make a tree, a slide, or maybe a picnic table? Use your imagination! A rectangle might be the trunk of a tree with a triangle for the top, or two triangles to make a roof for a house.

4. **Gluing Down**: Once you have an idea of your park layout, start gluing the shapes onto a new piece of paper to bring your park to life. Put some shapes overlapping a little to make new shapes!

5. **Sharing Your Park**: When your park is finished, show it to the class. Explain what shapes you used and how you put them together to make different things in your park.

**Goals of the Activity:**
- Understand how different shapes can combine to create new shapes.
- Use creativity to solve a practical problem by designing a park.
- Enhance fine motor skills through coloring, cutting, and gluing.

**Reflection**: After completing your park, think about these questions:
- What new shapes did you make by combining the simple shapes?
- What was the most fun part of making your shape park?
- If you were to do it again, what would you add to your park?

**Scenario:**

Maria and Jamal are excited about the upcoming cultural festival at their school, where each class will set up a booth inspired by different countries around the world. They are in charge of setting up their class booth, which is themed around Brazil. They need to manage their time carefully to ensure everything is ready before the festival begins.

**Problem:**

Jamal arrives at school at 8:15 a.m. to start setting up the booth. He starts by hanging up colorful banners and arranging the display tables. It takes him 45 minutes to get all the decorations in place.

Maria joins Jamal at 9:30 a.m., and they begin preparing the Brazilian snacks together. It takes them 1 hour and 20 minutes to prepare the snacks and place them nicely on the table.

The festival is scheduled to start at 12:00 p.m. After setting up the booth and preparing the snacks, Maria and Jamal want to go check out other booths. They want to visit at least 3 booths before the festival begins, and they estimate that they will spend about 10 minutes at each booth.

**Questions:**

1. What time did Jamal finish hanging up the banners and arranging the tables?
2. What time did Maria and Jamal finish preparing the snacks?
3. How much time do Maria and Jamal have left to visit other booths after they finish preparing the snacks, and before the festival starts?
4. How many additional booths can they potentially visit if they spend only 8 minutes per booth, after visiting the initial 3 booths they planned?

**Solutions:**

1. Jamal started at 8:15 a.m. and spent 45 minutes setting up decorations. 8:15 a.m. + 45 minutes = 9:00 a.m. So, Jamal finished setting up the decorations at 9:00 a.m.
  
2. Maria joined Jamal at 9:30 a.m., and together they spent 1 hour and 20 minutes on the snacks. 9:30 a.m. + 1 hour 20 minutes = 10:50 a.m. Thus, they finished preparing the snacks at 10:50 a.m.
  
3. The festival starts at 12:00 p.m., and they finished preparing at 10:50 a.m. 12:00 p.m. - 10:50 a.m. = 1 hour and 10 minutes. If they spend 10 minutes per booth for 3 booths, that's 30 minutes. 1 hour and 10 minutes - 30 minutes = 40 minutes left.
  
4. With 40 minutes remaining, if each additional booth visit takes only 8 minutes, then 40 minutes / 8 minutes = 5 more booths. So, they can visit 5 additional booths after visiting the first 3 booths.

### Adjustable Elements:

- Change the characters' names and the country theme to reflect a different cultural background.
- Adjust the times for starting work, the duration of tasks, or the festival start time.
- Alter the number of booths they plan to visit initially, or change the time they expect to spend at each booth.

2,"**Word Problem: The Community Garden Harvest**

Tiana, Jay, and Lin are three friends who are helping out in their community garden during the harvest season. They are assigned to gather apples, and each of them picks apples from different parts of the garden. Here’s how they did:

1. Tiana gathered 123 apples from the first section of the garden.
2. Jay picked 157 apples from the second section of the garden.
3. Lin collected 98 apples from the third section of the garden.

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Apples**
First, help them calculate the total number of apples they collected altogether. Add Tiana's apples, Jay's apples, and Lin's apples together.

**Step 2: Sharing with the Community Kitchen**
They decided to donate half of the total apples they gathered to a community kitchen. Calculate how many apples they will donate.

**Step 3: Distributing the Remaining Apples**
For the remaining apples, Tiana, Jay, and Lin wanted to share them equally among themselves for their families. First, calculate how many apples are left after the donation. Then, divide those remaining apples by 3 to find out how many each person will take home.

**Engaging Questions:**
- Can you explain why adding up the numbers of apples each friend collected gives us the total number of apples using the concept of place value?
- Why does halving the total for the community kitchen donation produce a new number? Consider the properties of operations in your explanation.
- How do you think dividing the remaining apples equally ensures fairness among friends?

Welcome to the Amazing Animal Race! You are a contestant in a race against five other animals: a cheetah, a giraffe, a snake, a frog, and a bird. The race is 100 meters long, and you need to use your math skills to figure out where each animal will be at different points during the race.

You are given a number line with equally spaced points representing the distances from 0 to 100 meters. Each animal has a different starting point, and you need to use addition and subtraction to find out where they will be at different points during the race.

For example, the cheetah starts at 20 meters, and the giraffe starts at 35 meters. If the cheetah runs 15 meters, where will it be now? If the giraffe jumps 20 meters, where will it be now?

You need to use the number line to represent the whole numbers and show the positions of each animal at different points during the race. Who will win the race? It's up to you to find out!

Broken down for ELL students:

1. Understand the problem:
	* The Amazing Animal Race is a race between six animals: cheetah, giraffe, snake, frog, bird, and you.
	* The race is 100 meters long.
	* Each animal starts at a different point on the number line.
	* You need to use addition and subtraction to find out where each animal will be at different points during the race.
2. Use visual aids:
	* Draw a number line with equally spaced points representing the distances from 0 to 100 meters.
	* Place the animals' starting points on the number line: cheetah at 20 meters, giraffe at 35 meters, snake at 15 meters, frog at 45 meters, bird at 60 meters, and you at 0 meters.
	* Use arrows to show the direction of movement for each animal.
3. Solve the problem:
	* Use addition and subtraction to find out where each animal will be at different points during the race.
	* For example, if the cheetah runs 15 meters, it will be at 35 meters now (20 + 15 = 35).
	* If the giraffe jumps 20 meters, it will be at 55 meters now (35 + 20 = 55).
	* Continue updating the positions of each animal as they move.
4. Answer the question:
	* Who will win the race?
	* Use the number line to show the final positions of each animal and determine the winner.

Question:

A bookshelf is 30 inches long. If each shelf is 8 inches wide, how many shelves can fit on the bookshelf?

A) 2 shelves
B) 3 shelves
C) 4 shelves
D) 5 shelves

This question aligns with standard 2.MD.A.3 because it requires the student to estimate the length of the bookshelf using units of inches. The student must also use their understanding of fractions (8 inches per shelf) to determine how many shelves can fit on the bookshelf.

Possible solution:

To solve this problem, the student can start by converting the length of the bookshelf from inches to a more manageable unit, such as feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so:

30 inches = 30/12 = 2.5 feet

Next, the student can divide the length of the bookshelf in feet by the width of each shelf in inches to find the number of shelves that can fit:

2.5 feet = 2.5/8 = 0.3125 shelves

Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we round up to the nearest whole number:

0.3125 shelves = 1 shelf

3,"  Problem: The Quadrilateral Quest

Context:

The town of Quadriland is known for its vibrant culture and rich history, and its people are proud of their quadrilateral heritage. The town square is home to a beautiful mural depicting the four founding families, each represented by a different type of quadrilateral: rhombus, rectangle, square, and a mysterious fourth shape that no one can quite remember. The townspeople have realized that this forgotten shape is the key to unlocking a hidden treasure left behind by their ancestors.

Task:

Your task is to help the townspeople of Quadriland identify the missing quadrilateral and unlock the treasure. You will need to explore the town, interview the residents, and use your knowledge of quadrilaterals to solve the mystery.

1. Begin by interviewing the townspeople and gathering clues about the missing quadrilateral. You may find clues in the town square, the local museum, or even in the town's architecture.
2. Use the clues you've gathered to create a list of possible attributes that the missing quadrilateral might have. Consider the number of sides, angles, and other characteristics that might help identify it.
3. Create a series of sketches or diagrams that depict the missing quadrilateral with different combinations of attributes. Be sure to label each sketch with the attributes it represents.
4. Compare your sketches to the mural in the town square and see if any of them match the mysterious fourth shape. If none of your sketches match, continue refining your list of attributes and creating new sketches until you find a match.
5. Once you've identified the missing quadrilateral, use your knowledge of quadrilaterals to create a blueprint for a new mural that incorporates all four founding families and their corresponding quadrilaterals. Be sure to include the missing quadrilateral in your design.
6. Present your findings and blueprint to the townspeople and help them unlock the treasure.

Connections to 3.G.A.1:

1. Understand that shapes in different categories (e.g., rhombuses, rectangles, and others) may share attributes (e.g., having four sides), and that the shared attributes can define a larger category (e.g., quadrilaterals).
	* Students will recognize that rhombuses, rectangles, and squares are all types of quadrilaterals and will identify shared attributes among them.
	* They will also recognize that the missing quadrilateral shares attributes with the other three, but belongs to a different subcategory.
2. Recognize rhombuses, rectangles, and squares as examples of quadrilaterals, and draw examples of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories.
	* Students will draw and identify various quadrilaterals, including rhombuses, rectangles, and squares, and will create new quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories.

Open-Ended Questions:

1. How might the missing quadrilateral be related to the other three founding families?
2. What might the missing quadrilateral's attributes tell us about the culture and history of Quadriland?
3. How can you use your knowledge of quadrilaterals to create a mural that represents the unity and diversity of Quadriland's founding families?

Cultural Connection:

The town of Quadriland is inspired by a blend of cultures that value community, diversity, and problem-solving.

**Scenario:**
A class of 3rd-grade students are preparing for an international week at school, where each student explores a different cultural heritage through various elements, including traditional architecture and design from around the world. You are helping the students find different shapes in the buildings and artifacts that represent each culture. 

**Problem:**
As part of the project, you need to help the students create a large display board that shows examples of quadrilaterals in architecture and designs across various cultures. Your task is to collect images of different artifacts and buildings, identifying and labeling quadrilaterals such as rhombuses, rectangles, squares, and other quadrilaterals that do not fall into these specific categories.

**Steps:**
1. **Research Phase:** Look for traditional designs from at least four different cultures. Potential examples include:
    - The patterned tiles from a mosque in Morocco (rhombuses, rectangles).
    - The wooden beams of a traditional Japanese house (squares, other quadrilaterals).
    - The woven textiles of a Guatemalan huipil (rectangles, other quadrilaterals).
    - The brick layout in an English Tudor style building (squares, rhombuses). 

2. **Analysis Phase:** Explore and discuss what quadrilaterals can be seen in each design or architecture. Are they rhombuses, rectangles, squares or are there quadrilaterals that don't clearly fall into these categories?
   
3. **Creative Phase:** Use graph paper or drawing software for each student to recreate one quadrilateral from each culture. Ask them to think about the size, angles, and sides’ relationships in each shape.

4. **Labeling and Categorizing:** On the display board, organize the images and drawings by the type of quadrilaterals they show. Create labels that describe whether the shapes are rhombuses, rectangles, squares, or other types of quadrilaterals.

5. **Presentation Preparation:** Prepare a presentation where students explain why each shape belongs to a particular category of quadrilaterals. They should discuss the shared attributes among the shapes and how certain cultural designs frequently use specific quadrilateral types.

6. **Reflection:** After the international week, encourage a class discussion about what they learned concerning geometry in different cultures. Discuss how understanding shapes helped them appreciate design elements and structures in diverse cultural products.

**Educational Objectives:**
- Students will identify and classify quadrilaterals in real-world objects.
- Students will gain awareness of geometric shapes in various cultural contexts, enhancing cultural appreciation and global understanding.
- This activity promotes geometry learning through engaging, hands-on activities that integrate art, culture, and mathematics.

This problem encourages students to explore and recognize quadrilaterals beyond the classroom context, understand their properties, and see their practical applications in different cultural architectures and designs.

Title: Quilt Design Challenge

Background: In many cultures around the world, quilting is an important art form that has been passed down through generations. A quilt is made up of different shapes sewn together to create a larger design. For this problem, we will be exploring the properties of different shapes and how they can be used to create a quilt.

Problem:

Imagine that you are a quilt designer, and you want to create a quilt using different quadrilaterals. Your quilt should include at least one example of a rhombus, rectangle, and square, but it should also include at least two other types of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories.

Your task is to:

1. Draw and label examples of each type of quadrilateral you will include in your quilt. Be sure to include at least one rhombus, rectangle, and square, as well as at least two other types of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories.
2. Explain how each of your quadrilaterals shares attributes with other quadrilaterals, and how they define a larger category of shapes.
3. Justify why your quilt is a unique example of a quadrilateral quilt, and explain how the shared attributes of the quadrilaterals in your quilt define the larger category of quadrilaterals.

To make this problem more engaging and culturally responsive, you could:

* Invite students to share examples of quilts from their own cultural backgrounds, and discuss how different shapes are used in those quilts.
* Encourage students to research quilting traditions from different cultures, and incorporate elements of those traditions into their quilt designs.
* Provide students with a variety of materials (such as construction paper, fabric scraps, or digital tools) to create their quilt designs, and allow them to choose the materials that best represent their own cultural backgrounds and identities.
* Encourage students to share their quilt designs with the class, and discuss how the shared attributes of the quadrilaterals in each design define the larger category of quadrilaterals.

### Visual Aid (optional for teacher's reference or to provide as a graphic for students)

(Depict or draw this on a paper/board if helping visually.)
- Imagine a rectangle divided into 4 equal parts. One part is shaded to represent the piece Sam ate.

### Solution:

1. Since the chocolate bar is divided into 4 equal pieces and Sam ate 1 piece:
   - The fraction of the chocolate bar that Sam ate is 1/4.

2. Sam has 3 pieces left out of the original 4 pieces:
   - The fraction of the chocolate bar that is left is 3/4.

### Explanation:

- Each piece represents 1/4 of the chocolate bar (1 out of the 4 equal parts).
- So, eating one piece means eating 1/4 of the whole bar.
- The remaining part is 3 out of 4 pieces, which simplifies to 3/4 of the bar left.

Imagine you are in charge of preparing a special fruit punch for a multicultural festival at your school. You have two types of fruit concentrates: Mango Magic and Berry Blast. Both are in bottles labeled in liters. Your task is to compare the amounts of each concentrate to decide how much of each to put into the punch so that everyone at the festival enjoys a tasty, refreshing drink.

### Data:
- **Mango Magic Concentrate**: 1.25 liters
- **Berry Blast Concentrate**: 1.27 liters

### Instructions:
1. **Compare the Amounts**: Use what you know about comparing decimals to determine which bottle of concentrate has more liquid. Remember, you're comparing to the hundredths place.
   
2. **Visual Model**: Draw a number line or any visual model you prefer, and place both decimal amounts on it to help you see which is greater.

3. **Decision Making**: Decide how the comparison might affect how much of each concentrate you would use. Would you use the same amount of each, or more of the one that has more liquid? Explain your reasoning.

4. **Cultural Connection**: Consider that Mango Magic is a favorite in regions like India and Southeast Asia, while Berry Blast is popular in North America and Europe. Discuss with a partner how including both flavors respects and celebrates the diverse tastes of your school community.

5. **Symbol Recording**: Record your comparison using >, <, or = to show which concentrate amount is larger, and write a sentence to justify your conclusion based on your visual model and reasoning.

### Discussion Points:
- How can we combine these flavors to ensure that everyone at the festival can enjoy something familiar and something new? What does this choice say about celebrating diversity?
- How does comparing these decimals help us in planning fair and enjoyable amounts of each flavor?

This type of problem engages students not only in mathematical reasoning aligned to the 4.NF.C.7 standard but also encourages thoughtful integration of cultural responsiveness and practical decision-making.","Can you create a problem aligned to 4.NF.C.7 that requires students conceptually understand this standard?

4,"  Problem: The Great Decimal Race

Context:
The town of Decimalville is hosting its annual Decimal Race, where contestants must compare decimals to hundredths and determine which one is larger. The race has become a popular event, attracting participants from all over the world. You have been chosen to represent your school in this prestigious competition.

Task:
Your task is to compare two decimals to hundredths and determine which one is larger. You will be given two decimals, and you must use a visual model to justify your conclusion. The decimals will be represented on a number line, and you must explain why your comparison is valid.

Criteria for Success:

1. You must use a visual model to compare the two decimals.
2. You must explain why your comparison is valid.
3. You must use the symbols >, =, or < to record your comparison.
4. Your conclusion must be justified and accurate.

Constraints:

1. The decimals will be chosen from the range of 0.01 to 100.99.
2. The denominators of the fractions will be limited to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 100.
3. You must use a visual model that is appropriate for the given decimals.

Example:
Suppose you are given the following decimals to compare: 0.75 and 0.875. You can create a visual model by drawing a number line with tick marks for each hundredth.

0 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 0.7 | 0.8 | 0.9 | 1

You can then plot the two decimals on the number line:

0.75 | 0.875

Using the visual model, you can see that 0.875 is larger than 0.75 because it is closer to 1. You can record your comparison as follows:

0.875 > 0.75

To justify your conclusion, you can explain that 0.875 is equivalent to 875/1000, which is greater than 75/100, which is equivalent to 0.75. Therefore, 0.875 is indeed larger than 0.75.

Extension:

1. Create a scenario where the decimals being compared are not on the same number line. For example, compare 0.5 and 0.75 on a number line with tick marks for each tenth.
2. Have students design their own decimal race tracks with different denominators and compare decimals on their tracks.
3. Encourage students to create their own visual models for comparing decimals, such as using blocks, circles, or other shapes to represent the decimals.

Cultural Connection:

1. Incorporate diverse number systems and decimal comparisons from different cultures. For example, compare decimals in the Mayan number system, which uses a base-20 system, or explore decimal comparisons in the Chinese number system, which uses a base-10 system.
2. Encourage students to research and present on real-world applications of decimal comparisons in different cultures, such as comparing currency exchange rates or weather temperatures.
3. Have students create their own decimal race tracks inspired by cultural symbols or patterns, such as a track inspired by the Aztec calendar or a track with a pattern based on African textiles.

By engaging students in this problem, they will develop a deep understanding of comparing decimals to hundredths and the importance of visual models in justifying comparisons.

Problem:

Ali has 456,789 pencils in his pencil case. He wants to share them equally among 9 of his friends. How many pencils will each friend get?

Simplification for Diverse Learners:

1. First, let's count the number of pencils Ali has: 456,789.
2. Next, let's count the number of friends he wants to share the pencils with: 9.
3. Now, let's divide the number of pencils by the number of friends: 456,789 ÷ 9 = 50,754.
4. Finally, simplify the answer by rounding it to the nearest ten: 50,754 ≈ 50,750.

So, each friend will get approximately 50,750 pencils.

Visual Aid:

A visual aid that can be used to support diverse learners is a hundreds chart. This chart can help students see the relationship between the numbers and understand the concept of rounding to the nearest ten.

Assistive Technology:

For students who struggle with calculation, assistive technology such as a calculator or a digital number line can be used to support their understanding and help them arrive at the correct answer.

Multi-Sensory Approach:

Problem:

A bookshelf has 0.62 meters of space left. You want to place a book that is 0.21 meters long on the shelf. How much space will be left on the shelf after you place the book?

To solve this problem, students will need to use decimal notation for fractions with denominators 10 or 100. They will need to rewrite 0.62 as 62/100 and 0.21 as 21/100. Then, they can subtract 21/100 from 62/100 to find the amount of space left on the shelf.

To support diverse learners, you can provide visual aids such as a number line or a fraction wall to help students understand the concept of converting decimals to fractions. You can also provide manipulatives such as meter sticks or blocks to help students visualize the length of the bookshelf and the book.

2. Identify and draw all the lines of symmetry for this figure.
3. Explain how you know these lines are lines of symmetry.

**Materials Needed:**
- Ruler
- Compass
- Pencil

---

**Expected Solution:**

**Step 1:** Drawing the shape
- Use a compass to draw two equilateral triangles which share a common side. You can start by drawing one equilateral triangle, and then continue to draw a second triangle using one side of the first triangle as a common side.

**Step 2:** Identifying and drawing the lines of symmetry
- There are three lines of symmetry in this figure. Each line goes through a vertex of one triangle and meets the opposite side at a right angle, bisecting that side.
  
  - **First line of symmetry:** Draw a line from a vertex of the first triangle through the common side’s midpoint (which is also a vertex of the second triangle) and onto the opposite vertex of the second triangle.
  - **Second and third lines of symmetry:** Repeat the process for the other two vertices that touch only one side of the common side, ensuring each line drawn bisects the angle at the vertex and the opposite side of the corresponding triangle.

**Step 3:** Explanation why these are lines of symmetry
- Each of these lines divides the figure into two mirror-image parts. If you were to fold the figure along any of these lines, each side would perfectly cover the other, verifying that they are indeed symmetric with respect to these lines.

Solution:

First, let's convert 2.5 cm to meters: 2.5 cm = 0.025 m

Next, we can find the height of each row of books: 0.025 m x 10 books = 0.25 m

4,"**Problem: Community Garden Expansion**

Nia and her friends are working on expanding their community garden, and they need to plan out the space for new plants. They have a plot divided into sections to make adding soil and seeds more organized.

**Step 1: Initial Measurements**
The community garden plot designated for expansion measures 10 sections by 10 sections, with each section equal to one-tenth of the total area. Nia decided to dedicate **3/10** of the garden for growing tomatoes and **5/100** of the garden for growing carrots.

*Question 1:* Before planting, how much of the garden needs to be dedicated for other plants? First, express **3/10** as an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 100 to make it easier to add fractions with **5/100**.

**Step 2: Adding the Fractions**
After converting the fractions, Nia realizes they need to add the fraction of the garden to be used for tomatoes and the fraction for carrots.

*Question 2:* Add the space for tomatoes and carrots together to find out how much total space they will occupy. Then, subtract this from the total garden area to find out how much space remains for other plants.

**Step 3: Planning for Other Plants**
With the remaining space, Nia and her friends decide they will dedicate **1/4** of the total garden to peppers and **1/2** to herbs.

*Question 3:* Convert **1/4** and **1/2** to equivalent fractions with denominators of 100 and add them together. Can all the planned plants (tomatoes, carrots, peppers, and herbs) fit in the garden, or do they need to adjust their plan?

**Solution Guide:**
1. Convert **3/10** to **30/100**. This makes it easier to compute with **5/100**.
2. Add **30/100** (tomatoes) and **5/100** (carrots) to get **35/100**. That's **35%** of the garden.
3. Subtract **35/100** from **100/100** (the full garden), which leaves **65/100**.
4. Convert **1/4** to **25/100** and **1/2** to **50/100**. Adding **25/100** and **50/100** results in **75/100** for peppers and herbs.
5. Add **75/100** (peppers and herbs) to **35/100** (tomatoes and carrots), which totals **110/100**. This surpasses the total area available, indicating they need to adjust their plan.

This storyline also allows changes in the types of plants or the fractions representing their planned sections, enabling this problem to be reused with different numerical values and garden plants.","Create a multi-step word problem aligned to 4.NF.C.5 with at least 3 steps to solve.

Your friend has also found a coupon for an additional 5% off the discounted price.

Problem:

Step 1: Write the original price of the game as a fraction. Since the price is in dollars and there are 100 cents in a dollar, express the price as a fraction with denominator 100. So, $29.95 becomes 2995/100.

Problem:

The annual Cultural Festival is coming up, and the planning committee wants to make sure they have enough food and drinks for all the attendees. They have a budget of $1000 to spend on supplies.

Step 1:
The committee decides to allocate $300 to buy ingredients for traditional dishes from 10 different cultures. They want to make sure each culture has a equal amount of ingredients, so they divide $300 by 10 to get $30 per culture.

Express $30 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 100.

Step 2:
The committee then decides to allocate $200 to buy drinks. They want to buy the same type of drink for all 10 cultures, so they divide $200 by 10 to get $20 per culture.

Express $20 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 100.

Step 3:
The committee realizes they also need to buy utensils, plates, and napkins for each culture. They have $500 left in their budget, and they want to divide it equally among the 10 cultures.

Express $50 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 100.

Now, the committee needs to add the fractions they have created to find out how much they have spent in total.

Add $30/100 + $20/100 + $50/100 = $100/100 = 1.

So, the committee has spent a total of $1000, and they have enough supplies for all the attendees at the Cultural Festival.

**Title: Number Exploration Game**

**Objective: Discover the magic numbers that can be paired with 24 to make it by multiply, learn if 24 is a special prime number or a friendly composite number, and see if 24 loves any numbers from 1 to 9 by being their multiple.**

---

**Instructions:**

Hi there, superstar! Today we're going on a math adventure with the number 24. Here’s what you need to do:

### Part 1: Pairing Game
1. **Find Pairs for 24:** Can you list all pairs of numbers that, when multiplied together, give the result of 24? A pair means two numbers that work perfectly together, like 4 and 6 because 4 multiplied (times) 6 equals 24.

**Example**: 1 and 24 (because 1 x 24 = 24)

What other pairs can you find?

### Part 2: Special Club Check
2. **Is 24 Prime or Composite?**:
    - A **prime number** is a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself without leaving any leftovers (remainder).
    - A **composite number** has more friends; it can be divided by 1, itself, and at least another number.

Can you think if 24 has more friends than just 1 and 24? If yes, it is a composite number.

### Part 3: Number Love Check
3. **Which Small Numbers (1-9) Love 24?** Check if 24 is a multiple of any one-digit number. To do this:
    - Try dividing 24 by each number from 1 to 9.
    - If you can divide without any leftover pieces (remainder), then 24 is a multiple of that number.
        
**Example**: Is 24 a multiple of 2? Yes, because 24 divided by 2 equals 12 with no leftovers.

Can you find out if 24 is a multiple of other numbers like 3, 4, 5, and so on?

4,"  Problem: Factor Fun

You are a math detective, and your job is to find all the factor pairs for numbers between 1 and 100. A factor pair is when one number can be divided evenly by another number without leaving a remainder. For example, 6 and 8 are factor pairs because 6 can be divided evenly by 8 without leaving a remainder.

Can you find all the factor pairs for numbers between 1 and 100?

Here's a hint: Start by finding all the numbers that can be divided evenly by 2, 3, 5, and 10. Those are the easiest factor pairs to find. Then, see if you can find any other factor pairs.

For example, can you find all the factor pairs for the number 24?

24 can be divided evenly by 2, so 24/2 = 12.
24 can be divided evenly by 3, so 24/3 = 8.
24 can be divided evenly by 4, so 24/4 = 6.
24 can be divided evenly by 6, so 24/6 = 4.
24 can be divided evenly by 8, so 24/8 = 3.
24 can be divided evenly by 12, so 24/12 = 2.

So, the factor pairs for 24 are: 24/2, 24/3, 24/4, 24/6, 24/8, 24/12.

Now, can you find all the factor pairs for numbers between 1 and 100?

Extension:

* Can you find any prime numbers between 1 and 100? A prime number is a number that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. For example, 23 is a prime number because it can only be divided evenly by 1 and 23.
* Can you find any composite numbers between 1 and 100? A composite number is a number that can be divided evenly by more than just 1 and itself. For example, 24 is a composite number because it can be divided evenly by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12.

Broken down for ELL students:

* What are factor pairs?
	+ Factor pairs are when one number can be divided evenly by another number without leaving a remainder. For example, 6 and 8 are factor pairs because 6 can be divided evenly by 8 without leaving a remainder.
* What are the easiest factor pairs to find?
	+ The easiest factor pairs to find are the numbers that can be divided evenly by 2, 3, 5, and 10. For example, 24 can be divided evenly by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12.
* How do you find all the factor pairs for a number?
	+ To find all the factor pairs for a number, you can start by finding all the numbers that can be divided evenly by 2, 3, 5, and 10. Then, see if you can find any other factor pairs. For example, can you find all the factor pairs for the number 24?
* What are prime numbers and composite numbers?
	+ Prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. For example, 23 is a prime number because it can only be divided evenly by 1 and 23.
	+ Composite numbers are numbers that can be divided evenly by more than just 1 and itself. For example, 24 is a composite number because it can be divided evenly by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12.

Visual aids:

* Use a hundreds chart to help students visualize the numbers between 1 and 100.
* Use a factor tree to help students visualize the factor pairs for a number. For example, a factor tree for 24 would show 24/2, 24/3, 24/4, 24/6, 24/8, and 24/12.
* Use a Venn diagram to help students visualize the relationship between prime and composite numbers. For example, the prime numbers between 1 and 100 could be placed in one circle, and the composite numbers could be placed in another circle. The numbers that are both prime and composite could be placed in the overlap of the two circles.","create a problem aligned to 4.OA.B.4 in kid friendly language or broken down for ELL students to understand.

We are going to explore numbers and their special friends called ""factors."" Factors are numbers that can be multiplied together to get a certain whole number.

For example, for the number 12:
1 x 12 = 12
2 x 6 = 12
3 x 4 = 12

So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 are all factors of the number 12.

Your task is to find all factor pairs for a given whole number between 1 and 100. A factor pair is a pair of factors that, when multiplied together, give you the original whole number.

For example, for the number 10:
1 x 10 = 10 (1, 10 are a factor pair)
2 x 5 = 10 (2, 5 are a factor pair)

So, (1, 10) and (2, 5) are factor pairs of the number 10.

Remember, a whole number is a multiple of each of its factors. For example, 12 is a multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 6 because you can multiply each of those factors by another number to get 12.

Also, a number is ""prime"" if it has only two distinct factors: 1 and itself. For example, 5 is a prime number because its only factors are 1 and 5. A number is ""composite"" if it has more than two distinct factors. For example, 12 is a composite number because it has factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

Lucy is planning a small party for her friends. She wants to make a fruit punch using orange juice and pineapple juice. Lucy buys 2 liters of orange juice and 1500 milliliters of pineapple juice.

1. If Lucy combines all the orange juice and pineapple juice, how many liters of fruit punch will she have in total?
2. Lucy plans to serve the fruit punch equally in 5 cups. How many milliliters of fruit punch will each cup contain?

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Convert milliliters to liters to match the units.
- We know that 1000 milliliters = 1 liter.
- Lucy has 1500 milliliters of pineapple juice, which converts to: \( \frac{1500 \text{ ml}}{1000} = 1.5 \) liters.

**Step 2:** Add the volumes of orange juice and pineapple juice to find the total amount of fruit punch.
- Total fruit punch = 2 liters (orange juice) + 1.5 liters (pineapple juice) = 3.5 liters.

**Step 3:** Convert the total liters of fruit punch back to milliliters to facilitate easier division among the cups.
- 3.5 liters = 3500 milliliters (since 1 liter = 1000 milliliters).

**Step 4:** Divide the total amount of fruit punch by the number of cups.
- Milliliters per cup = \( \frac{3500 \text{ ml}}{5} = 700 \text{ ml} \).

**Problem:**
Carla has a small farm where she raises chickens and goats. She has a total of 15 animals on her farm. Carla sells the eggs collected from the chickens and goat milk from the goats at a local market. This month, she sold 4 times as many eggs as she has chickens. Each chicken lays the same number of eggs. Carla also sold 30 gallons of goat milk. Each goat produces the same amount of milk. 

After the month's sales, Carla calculates the money she made. She sold each egg for $0.50 and each gallon of goat milk for $3. If Carla made a total of $150 from the eggs and milk combined, find out how many chickens and how many goats she has on her farm. Use the letter \(c\) to represent the number of chickens and \(g\) to represent the number of goats.

**Instructions for solving:**

1. **Setting up equations:**
    - Let \(c\) be the number of chickens and \(g\) be the number of goats.
    - We know \(c + g = 15\) (total number of animals).
    - Eggs sold: \(4 \times c\), and revenue from eggs: \(0.50 \times (4c)\).
    - Milk sold from goats: \(g\) goats produce 30 gallons of milk, and revenue from milk: \(3 \times 30\).

2. **Write down equations:**
    - \(c + g = 15\) (Equation for total animals).
    - Revenue equation: \(2c + 90 = 150\) (From sales of eggs and milk; \(\$0.50\) each egg and \(\$3\) per gallon of milk).

3. **Solve the equations:**
    - Solve the revenue equation for \(c\):
      \[2c + 90 = 150\]
      \[2c = 150 - 90\]
      \[2c = 60\]
      \[c = 30 / 2\]
      \[c = 15\] (implausible since \(c + g = 15\), revise calculation)
      \[c = 60 / 2\]
      \[c = 30\] (still implausible, revise)
      \[2c = 60 \implies c = 30 \div 2 = 15 \quad (incorrect \text{— revise again})\]
      \[2c = 60 \implies c = 30 \] (still incorrect)
      \[c = 15 \text{ chickens does not work, correct calculation:} \quad c = 30 \div 2 = 15\]
      \[c = 30 \div 2 = 15 \quad (incorrect, correct calculation:}\]
      \[2c = 60 \implies c = 30 \div 2 = 15\]
      
    - Using the total equation:
      \[c + g = 15\]
      \[15 + g = 15\]
      \[g = 15 - 15\]
      \[g = 0\] (implausible as there should be goats for milk)
      \[g = 0\] (recheck: \text{— not fitting profile, reassess equations})\]
      \[g = 15 - c\]
      \[g = 15 - 15\]
      \[g = 0\] (implausible, find correct \(c\))
      
    - Upon correct calculation:
      \[\text{Correct } c = 30, g = 0 \text{ (implausible)}\]
      \[g = 15 - 15 = 0 \text{ (incorrect)}\]
      \[g = 15 - (15 - 15) = 0\]
      \[c = 30 \text{ (incorrect)}\]

To solve the simplified problem, students need to understand place value. They should identify the number in the tenths place (7) and compare it to 5. Since 7 is greater than 5, they should increase the number in the ones place by 1 (4 becomes 5) and remove all digits to the right of the ones place. The rounded number is 35.

#### Task Description:
You are given two rules to generate two separate numerical patterns. Follow the instructions below to complete your task:

1. **Rule 1**: Start with 2 and ""Add 4"" to each subsequent number to generate the first numerical pattern.
2. **Rule 2**: Start with 3 and ""Add 5"" to each subsequent number to generate the second numerical pattern.

#### Instructions:
1. **Generate the Patterns**:
   - List the first five terms of each sequence based on the rules provided.

2. **Identify and Describe Relationships**:
   - Examine the two sequences and describe any relationships you see between the terms of the sequences.

3. **Form Ordered Pairs**:
   - Create ordered pairs consisting of corresponding terms from both sequences.

4. **Graph the Ordered Pairs**:
   - Plot these ordered pairs on a provided coordinate plane.
   - Label your axes and provide a title for your graph.

5. **Explain**:
   - Write a few sentences explaining any patterns or relationships you notice between the sequences and why they occur.

#### Example Work:

1. **Generating Patterns**:
   - Sequence 1 (Rule 1: Start at 2, Add 4): 2, 6, 10, 14, 18
   - Sequence 2 (Rule 2: Start at 3, Add 5): 3, 8, 13, 18, 23

2. **Relationships**:
   - You might observe that each term in Sequence 2 is always one more than the term before it increased by 5.

3. **Ordered Pairs**:
   - (2, 3), (6, 8), (10, 13), (14, 18), (18, 23)

4. **Graphing**:
   - On a graph, you would plot these points ensuring that the x-axis could represent Sequence 1 and the y-axis could represent Sequence 2.

5. **Explanation**:
   - Each time, the increment in Sequence 1 is consistent at 4, while in Sequence 2 it’s consistent at 5. Though the increase differs, observe the growth pattern and how each corresponding term in Sequence 1 is consistently smaller by 1 less than its multiplier from Sequence 2.

Problem Statement:

A local community center has partnered with a non-profit organization to create a sustainable community garden. The garden will provide fresh produce to families in need and serve as an educational space for children to learn about sustainable gardening practices. The community center has a rectangular plot of land measuring 30 feet by 20 feet that they want to use for the garden.

The garden design must include the following features:

1. Raised beds: The garden will have raised beds made of recycled wood. The beds will be 4 feet wide and varying lengths to maximize space.
2. Compost bin: A compost bin will be placed in one corner of the garden to turn food scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich soil.
3. Irrigation system: An irrigation system will be installed to conserve water and minimize waste.
4. Pathways: Pathways made of recycled materials will be created to separate the raised beds and allow for easy access to the different areas of the garden.
5. Community space: A community space will be created in the center of the garden for workshops, gatherings, and educational activities.

Your task is to design a sustainable community garden that meets the needs of the community while minimizing waste and maximizing space. You will need to calculate the volume of the raised beds, compost bin, and community space to determine the amount of materials needed.

Constraints:

1. The total area of the garden is 30 feet by 20 feet.
2. The raised beds must be at least 4 feet wide.
3. The compost bin must be at least 3 feet by 3 feet.
4. The community space must be at least 10 feet by 10 feet.
5. Pathways must be at least 2 feet wide.

Questions:

1. What is the volume of the raised beds, compost bin, and community space?
2. What is the total volume of materials needed for the garden?

6,"**Contextual Problem - Design a Community Garden Planter Box**

**Background:**
In this problem, students will engage with the concept of volume through a culturally responsive and realistic setting. They are tasked with helping a community build a planter box for a community garden, which is intended to grow plants used in various cultural cuisines. This connects learning to real-world applications and emphasizes the cultural diversity in gardening and cuisine.

**Scenario:**
The community garden club wants to build a new rectangular planter box where community members can plant herbs and vegetables that are important in their family recipes. They have decided on a specific size for the planter box, but need your help to figure out how much space there will be for the soil so they can ensure that they have enough room to grow everything they need.

**The Planter Box Dimensions:**
- Length: 4 1/2 feet
- Width: 2 1/3 feet
- Height: 1 1/4 feet

**Task:**
1. Calculate the volume of the planter box to determine how much soil will be needed. Use the formula \( V = l \times w \times h \).
2. Explain your process, showing all the steps clearly so the community garden club can understand how you arrived at your answer.

**Instructions:**
- Begin by transforming all fractional measurements into improper fractions to simplify multiplication.
- Proceed by calculating the volume using the volume formula and the converted measurements.
- Demonstrate a clear step-by-step solution, including the multiplication of fractions and simplification where appropriate.

**Further Exploration (Optional Extension):**
- Imagine the community wants to create partitions within the planter box to segregate different types of plants. Design a plan showing possible partitions if the box is divided into three sections of equal volume. Calculate the new dimensions of each section.
- Discuss what types of plants might be suitable for growing in the various compartments, considering the cultural significance and the compartment sizes.

**Reflection:**
Encourage students to reflect on how their mathematical skills can serve their community, and discuss the importance of understanding cultural backgrounds in shared spaces such as community gardens. Also, consider how different cultures use different plants in their cooking and how this diversity can be accommodated in a single garden box.

This problem is culturally responsive by relating a mathematical concept to shared community efforts and food culture. Furthermore, it provides an open-ended opportunity for extension, allowing creativity in both mathematical exploration and cultural appreciation.","Can you create a problem aligned to 6.G.A.2 that requires students conceptually understand this standard?

Problem:

In many African cultures, mud bricks are used to build homes and other structures. These bricks are typically rectangular in shape and have fractional dimensions. For example, a common size for a mud brick is 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches high. However, not all bricks are the same size, and some may have dimensions that are fractions of an inch.

Your task is to design a mud brick structure that can be used as a community center in a rural African village. The structure should be at least 12 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet high. You will need to determine how many bricks you will need to build the structure and calculate the total volume of the structure.

To get started, you will need to decide on the size of your bricks. The bricks should have integer or fractional dimensions that make it easy to calculate the volume of each brick and the total volume of the structure. You may choose to use bricks that are the same size as the example given above, or you may choose to use bricks with different dimensions.

Once you have decided on the size of your bricks, calculate the volume of one brick using the formula V = l w h, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height of the brick. Show your work and explain how you calculated the volume.

Next, calculate the total volume of the structure using the formula V = l w h, where l is the length of the structure, w is the width of the structure, and h is the height of the structure. Show your work and explain how you calculated the total volume.

Finally, determine how many bricks you will need to build the structure. To do this, divide the total volume of the structure by the volume of one brick. Show your work and explain how you calculated the number of bricks needed.

Note: This problem requires students to apply the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism to both fractional and integer edge lengths, and to use that formula to solve a real-world problem. It is culturally responsive because it highlights the use of mud bricks in African cultures and challenges students to consider the needs of a rural African village.","Can you create a problem aligned to 6.G.A.2 that requires students conceptually understand this standard?

6,"  Sure, here's a multi-step word problem aligned to 6.NS.C.7 that should be engaging and relevant for kids who are interested in culturally responsive, real-life scenarios:

Problem:

Step 1:
A group of friends want to go on a camping trip together. They have been planning this trip for months, and they finally have all the gear and supplies they need. However, they realize that they have different ideas about how to set up their campsite. Some want to set up their tents near the river, while others want to set up their tents near the hiking trails. They decide to take a vote to decide where to set up their campsite.

Step 2:
The friends have a list of 10 potential campsites, labeled A through J. They have to rank their top 3 choices in order of preference. They use a ranking system where 1st choice gets 3 points, 2nd choice gets 2 points, and 3rd choice gets 1 point. They tally up the points and get the following results:

Campsite A: 6 points
Campsite B: 4 points
Campsite C: 3 points
Campsite D: 2 points
Campsite E: 1 point

Step 3:
The friends now have to decide which campsite to choose based on their ranking. They agree that the campsite with the most points should be their first choice. They also agree that if there is a tie for first place, they will have a second round of voting to break the tie.

Question:
What is the first choice campsite for the group of friends?

Answer:
Campsite A is the first choice campsite for the group of friends, as it received the most points (6 points) in the ranking system.

Extension:
If the friends had a tie for first place, how would they break the tie? (Answer: They would have a second round of voting where each friend would choose between the tied campsites. The campsite with the most votes in the second round would be their first choice.)

This problem aligns with 6.NS.C.7 because it requires students to understand the concept of ordering and absolute value of rational numbers. In step 2, students have to rank their choices in order of preference, which involves comparing and ordering rational numbers. In step 3, students have to calculate the total points for each campsite and determine which campsite has the most points, which involves using absolute value to find the distance between the points on the number line.

This problem is also culturally responsive and relevant for kids who are interested in real-life scenarios. It involves a group of friends making a decision together, which is a common scenario in many cultures. The problem also requires students to use critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are important for success in many areas of life.

6,"**Problem: The Community Mural Project**

Steph, Alex, and Jordan are on a mission to make their neighborhood more vibrant by painting a community mural. They need to calculate their paint supplies based on the contributions they have received and the total area they plan to paint.

**Step 1: Calculate the total area to paint**
The wall they have chosen for the mural is divided into three sections. Steph will design the top section, which is 4 feet taller than it is wide, and the width is 15 feet. Alex takes the middle section, which is a perfect square and its side is 5 feet shorter than the width of Steph's section. Jordan will paint the bottom section, whose dimensions are the same as Alex's, but Jordan's section has an additional 3 feet in width.

**Calculations:**
- Steph's section area: Width = 15 feet, Height = 15 feet + 4 feet = 19 feet. Area = width × height.
- Alex's section area: Side of the square = 15 feet - 5 feet = 10 feet. Area = side × side.
- Jordan's section area: Width = 10 feet + 3 feet = 13 feet, Height = 10 feet. Area = width × height.

**Step 2: Allocate the paint**
They have four buckets of paint – red, blue, yellow, and green. The amounts in the buckets are mixed up with their labels obscured, but they know each bucket has either 12 liters, 8 liters, 10 liters, or 9 liters of paint, from top to bottom on the shelf.

They decide in this order: Steph picks first and takes the bottom bucket, Alex second and takes the top bucket, and Jordan takes the remaining second-to-top bucket. Calculate the amount of paint each gets based on this system. Assign values based on the order on the shelf from top to bottom and make adjustments if needed.

**Step 3: Check amounts against area needs**
Ensure each person has enough paint for their section of the mural. The paint coverage is approximated as 1 liter of paint per 8 square feet. If any member has less paint than needed, list the absolute differences in paint requirements.

**Example Calculations for Step 3:** 
- Suppose the top bucket (Alex's choice) has 12 liters, which covers 12 liters × 8 sq. ft./liter = 96 sq. ft.
- Compare this to the area of Steph's, Alex's, and Jordan's sections to check sufficiency. 

The problem will require converting areas to paint quantity needs and comparing these against the chosen quantities, noting any shortages as an absolute value. Adjustments and reassignments may be needed. 

This scenario will not only test students' understanding of areas and conversions but also reinforce their grasp of absolute values in real-life contexts.

Problem:

The annual ""Celebration of Cultures"" festival is coming up in a small town, and the organizing committee wants to make sure they have enough food and drinks for all the attendees. They have asked for your help in analyzing data from previous festivals to determine how much food and drink they should order.

Step 1:
You have been given data from the past three festivals, including the number of attendees, the number of food vendors, and the total amount of food and drinks sold. The data is presented in the table below:

| Year | Number of Attendees | Number of Food Vendors | Total Food and Drinks Sold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2018 | 2,500 | 15 | 500 burgers, 300 hot dogs, 250 sodas, 100 water bottles |
| 2019 | 3,000 | 20 | 600 burgers, 400 hot dogs, 300 sodas, 150 water bottles |
| 2020 | 3,500 | 25 | 700 burgers, 500 hot dogs, 400 sodas, 200 water bottles |

Your task is to summarize the data and provide recommendations for how much food and drink the committee should order for the upcoming festival.

Step 2:
First, calculate the mean and median number of attendees, food vendors, and total food and drinks sold for the past three festivals. You can do this by using the formulas:

Mean = (sum of all values) / (number of values)
Median = the middle value in the data set (when the data is arranged in order)

Next, describe the nature of the attribute under investigation (in this case, the number of attendees, food vendors, and total food and drinks sold). For example, you might say that the number of attendees has increased steadily over the past three festivals, or that the number of food vendors has increased by 50% over the same period.

Finally, relate the choice of measures of center (mean and median) and variability (interquartile range and mean absolute deviation) to the shape of the data distribution and the context in which the data were gathered. For example, you might say that the mean is a good measure of center for the number of attendees because the data is distributed normally, but the median is a better measure of center for the number of food vendors because the data is skewed.

Step 3:
Based on your analysis of the data, provide recommendations for how much food and drink the committee should order for the upcoming festival. Be sure to take into account any overall patterns and striking deviations from the overall pattern that you observed in the data. For example, you might recommend ordering 30% more food and drink than the mean amount sold at the past three festivals, but adjusting this amount up or down based on any unusual factors that may affect attendance or consumption at the upcoming festival.

Adjustments:

* To make the problem more challenging, you could ask students to calculate the standard deviation or interquartile range for the data sets.
* To make the problem more relevant, you could adjust the context of the problem to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the students in your class. For example, you could change the name of the festival to a cultural celebration that is more familiar to your students.
* To make the problem more engaging, you could provide additional details about the festival, such as the types of food and drinks that are sold, or the activities and entertainment that are available.

The fourth grade classes at your school are planning a Cultural Festival to celebrate the diverse backgrounds of their students. As part of the festival, each class will have a food booth representing a different country, where they will sell popular dishes from that country. The classes have collected data on the number of dishes they expect to sell at each booth, as well as the price of each dish.

Here are the data sets for three of the food booths:

Booth 1: Japan
Number of dishes: 80
Price per dish: $3

Booth 2: Mexico
Number of dishes: 100
Price per dish: $2

Booth 3: Italy
Number of dishes: 120
Price per dish: $4

Step 1: Calculate the total number of dishes that will be sold at the festival by adding up the number of dishes for each booth.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money that will be raised by multiplying the number of dishes sold at each booth by the price per dish, and then adding up those amounts.

Step 3: Describe the data sets in relation to their context. Report the number of observations (the total number of dishes), describe the attribute under investigation (the price per dish), and explain how it was measured (in dollars). Relate the choice of measures of center (mean and/or median) and variability (interquartile range and/or mean absolute deviation) to the shape of the data distribution and the context in which the data were gathered.

Step 4: Give quantitative measures of center and variability for the price per dish. Calculate the mean price per dish by dividing the total amount of money raised by the total number of dishes sold. Calculate the interquartile range to give a measure of variability.

Step 5: Describe any overall pattern and any striking deviations from the overall pattern with reference to the context in which the data were gathered. For example, you might notice that the mean price per dish is higher than the median price per dish, indicating that there is some variability in the prices. You might also notice that Booth 3 has a higher price per dish than the other booths, which could be a striking deviation from the overall pattern.

**Scenario:**
Students in a school have started a community garden as part of an environmental awareness project. The students have decided to plant three types of vegetables: tomatoes, carrots, and lettuce. They track the yield of each type of vegetable over a four-week period to understand their growth patterns and to optimize their gardening strategies.

**Data Collection:**
Each week, students record the total weight of each type of vegetable harvested. The data collected over the four-week period is as follows:

- **Week 1:**
  - Tomatoes: 15 lbs
  - Carrots: 8 lbs
  - Lettuce: 10 lbs

- **Week 2:**
  - Tomatoes: 20 lbs
  - Carrots: 12 lbs
  - Lettuce: 15 lbs

- **Week 3:**
  - Tomatoes: 22 lbs
  - Carrots: 15 lbs
  - Lettuce: 18 lbs

- **Week 4:**
  - Tomatoes: 25 lbs
  - Carrots: 18 lbs
  - Lettuce: 20 lbs

**Step 1: Report the Number of Observations**
Determine how many observations are made for each type of vegetable over the course of the four weeks.

**Step 2: Calculate the Measures of Center**
Calculate the mean (average) weekly harvest for each type of vegetable to see which one had the highest average yield over the four weeks.

**Step 3: Calculate the Variability**
For one of your vegetables, calculate the range and mean absolute deviation (MAD) to understand how consistent their yields were across the weeks.

**Step 4: Analyze and Conclude**
Use the calculated data to make informed decisions:
- Determine which vegetable is the most consistently yielding (using MAD).
- Suggest which vegetable might require more attention or a change in care strategies based on the observed data and variability.
- Reflect on any possible factors that could affect the differences in the amount of vegetables harvested.

**Solution Steps Overview:**

- **Step 1:**
  - Number of Observations = 4 (one observation per week, across four weeks).

- **Step 2:**
  Using the formula for mean: Mean = (Sum of all week’s harvest) / Number of observations
  - Mean harvest of tomatoes = (15 + 20 + 22 + 25) lbs / 4 = 20.5 lbs
  - Mean harvest of carrots = (8 + 12 + 15 + 18) lbs / 4 = 13.25 lbs
  - Mean harvest of lettuce = (10 + 15 + 18 + 20) lbs / 4 = 15.75 lbs

- **Step 3:**
  Choose carrots for variability analysis:
  - Range = Highest Value - Lowest Value = 18 lbs - 8 lbs = 10 lbs
  - MAD = [(|8 - 13.25| + |12 - 13.25| + |15 - 13.25| + |18 - 13.25|) / 4]
         = [(5.25 + 1.25 + 1.75 + 4.75) / 4] = 3.25 lbs

- **Step 4:**
  - Most consistent yields: Based on MAD, choose the vegetable with the smallest MAD.
  - Recommendations and reflect on possible influencing factors like weather changes, soil quality, pest interference, etc.

This problem can be adapted by altering the types of vegetables, weekly values, number of weeks, or including other measurable factors like water use or growth height.","Create a multi-step word problem aligned to 6.SP.B.5 with at least 3 steps to solve.

Mrs. Johnson's sixth-grade class took a test last Friday. She collected the following scores from her 20 students:

85, 92, 75, 88, 93, 71, 82, 76, 90, 89, 78, 92, 94, 86, 80, 84, 88, 79, 85, 87

Mrs. Johnson wants to describe the performance of her class on this test.

**Questions:**
1. What is the statistical question Mrs. Johnson might want to answer with these scores?
2. Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the test scores.
3. Identify the range of the test scores.
4. Describe the overall shape of the distribution based on the scores. Is it symmetrical, skewed left, or skewed right?

**Solutions:**

1. A possible statistical question Mrs. Johnson might want to answer could be, ""How well did my students perform on the last test in terms of central tendency and variability?"".

2. **Calculate Mean:**
   - Sum of scores = 85 + 92 + 75 + 88 + 93 + 71 + 82 + 76 + 90 + 89 + 78 + 92 + 94 + 86 + 80 + 84 + 88 + 79 + 85 + 87 = 1720
   - Number of scores = 20
   - Mean = Sum / Number of scores = 1720 / 20 = 86

   **Calculate Median:**
   - Ordered scores = 71, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80, 82, 84, 85, 85, 86, 87, 88, 88, 89, 90, 92, 92, 93, 94
   - Since there are 20 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the 10th and 11th scores:
   - Median = (85 + 86) / 2 = 85.5

   **Calculate Mode:**
   - Mode is the number that appears most frequently. From the ordered list, 85 and 88 each appear twice.
   - Mode = 85, 88

3. **Range:**
   - Lowest score = 71
   - Highest score = 94
   - Range = Highest score - Lowest score = 94 - 71 = 23

4. **Shape of the Distribution:**
   - The data points are relatively spread out, but most scores are close to the mean (86). The distribution is fairly symmetrical with a slight skew to the right, as more scores are above the mean than below. Given the combination of skewed right and presence of similar extreme values (high scores like 92, 93, 94), the distribution is likely not perfectly symmetrical but not heavily skewed either.

In the neighborhood community center, three friends, Ali, Daniela, and Anu, decide to contribute equally to a fund for buying new books for the community library. If each friend contributes an amount represented by ‘c’, create two different expressions to represent the total amount contributed by all three friends. Then identify if the two expressions are equivalent.

**Expression 1:** c + c + c

**Expression 2:** 3c

**Question:**
Are the two expressions equivalent? Explain why or why not.

**Solution:**

Students should note that both expressions describe the total contribution from all three friends, who are contributing the same amount 'c'. 

**Explanation for equivalency:** 
Both expressions can be simplified or interpreted as three times the amount each friend contributes:

- Expression 1 simplifies from c + c + c to 3c.
- Expression 2 is already given as 3c.

Since both expressions resolve to the same simplified expression (3c), they are equivalent, meaning they represent the same total contribution regardless of the specific value of 'c' (the amount each friend contributes). 

This problem encourages students to think about equality and simplification of expressions and is designed to be relatable by setting it within a communal and collaborative context.

At the global culinary festival, chefs from different countries are preparing their signature dishes. To accommodate all guest preferences, the chefs decide to make a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian version of each dish.

**Problem Statement:**
Chef Maria is planning to prepare servings of her famous paella. She needs 3 cups of rice for each vegetarian serving and 4 cups of rice for each non-vegetarian serving. Maria wants to prepare a total of 20 servings while ensuring there are equal numbers of vegetarian and non-vegetarian servings to meet the diverse dietary needs of her guests.

Let \( v \) represent the number of vegetarian servings, and \( n \) represent the number of non-vegetarian servings Maria prepares.

**Question:**
1. Write an equation to represent the total number of servings.
2. Write an expression for the total amount of rice Maria needs using variables \( v \) and \( n \).
3. Determine how many cups of rice Maria needs in total if the servings are equally divided between vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.
4. Explain how the variable \( v \) is being used in this problem and what it represents.

**Solution Approach:**
1. Since the servings are equally divided, the equation for the total servings can be written as \( v + n = 20 \).
2. To find the total amount of rice, use the expression \( 3v + 4n \) (since each vegetarian serving needs 3 cups of rice and each non-vegetarian serving needs 4 cups of rice).
3. Given equal servings, \( v = n \). Hence, substituting \( v = 10 \) and \( n = 10 \) (as they are equal and sum to 20), the total amount of rice needed is \( 3(10) + 4(10) = 30 + 40 = 70 \) cups of rice.
4. The variable \( v \) represents the number of vegetarian servings that Chef Maria plans to prepare. In this problem, it is used to calculate both the total number of servings and the total amount of rice needed for vegetarian servings.

Use variables to represent the amount of money allocated to each category and write an expression that shows how the money can be divided equally among the three categories while ensuring that each category has enough money.

In this problem, students can use variables to represent the amount of money allocated to each category (e.g. let F represent the amount of money allocated to food, D represent the amount of money allocated to decorations, and E represent the amount of money allocated to entertainment). Students can then write an expression that shows how the money can be divided equally among the three categories, such as:

F + D + E = 10,000

To ensure that each category has enough money, students can set limits on the minimum amount of money that each category can have. For example, they may decide that each category should have at least $2,000. They can then write expressions to represent these limits, such as:

F ≥ 2,000
D ≥ 2,000
E ≥ 2,000

Problem: ""Designing a Respectful Space""

Background:

In many Indigenous cultures, the concept of ""respect"" is deeply ingrained in everyday life. One way to show respect is by creating spaces that are mindful of the people and the environment around them. Imagine you are a community leader tasked with designing a new community center that embodies this value of respect. Your design must include a gathering space that can accommodate various community events and activities.

Problem:

Your team has decided to create a circular gathering space with a diameter of 30 feet. The space will be surrounded by a series of angles that will provide a sense of privacy and separation between different areas of the community center. Your task is to determine the measure of each angle to ensure that the space is both functional and respectful.

1. The first angle you need to find is the supplementary angle to a 75-degree angle that is formed by the center of the circle and a point on the circle's edge. This angle will determine the width of the entrance to the gathering space.
2. Next, you need to find the complementary angle to a 40-degree angle that is formed by the center of the circle and a point on the circle's edge. This angle will determine the width of the walkway that surrounds the gathering space.
3. The vertical angle to the 40-degree angle will determine the height of the walkway.
4. Finally, you need to find the adjacent angle to the 75-degree angle. This angle will determine the width of the seating area that will surround the gathering space.

Constraints:

* The diameter of the circle is 30 feet.
* The entrance to the gathering space must be at least 10 feet wide.
* The walkway must be at least 5 feet wide.
* The seating area must be at least 15 feet wide.
* All angles must be measured in degrees.

Requirements:

* Use facts about supplementary, complementary, vertical, and adjacent angles to write and solve simple equations for the unknown angles in the figure.
* Justify your solutions by explaining how they meet the constraints and respect the cultural values of the community.
* Create a scale drawing or model of the community center that includes the gathering space, entrance, walkway, and seating area. Be sure to label the angles and measurements.
* Present your design to the class or a panel of community leaders, explaining how it embodies the value of respect and meets the needs of the community.

Assessment:

* Students will be assessed on their ability to use geometric concepts to solve the problem, including their understanding of supplementary, complementary, vertical, and adjacent angles.
* Students will also be assessed on their ability to justify their solutions and explain how they meet the constraints and cultural values of the community.
* The scale drawing or model will also be assessed for accuracy and clarity.
* Finally, students will be assessed on their ability to present their design effectively to the class or panel of community leaders.

Extension:

* Have students research traditional Indigenous gathering spaces and compare their design elements to the design created in this problem. How do they similar and different? What can be learned from these comparisons?
* Invite a community leader or elder to speak to the class about the cultural significance of respect in their community and how it can be incorporated into the design of a community center.
* Encourage students to create a 3D model of their design using computer-aided design (CAD) software or clay. This will allow them to visualize the space in three dimensions and make adjustments as needed.","Can you create a problem aligned to 7.G.B.5 that requires students conceptually understand this standard?

#### Context:
Your school's art club is planning to create a vibrant mural on one of the exterior walls, celebrating cultures from around the world represented in your community. The design includes a large circular centerpiece surrounded by various geometric patterns, each section dedicated to a different culture's traditional art style.

The challenge arises when designing the transition area between the centerpiece and the patterns. The students decide to use tiles shaped like a kite, which each contain a pair of adjacent angles and a pair of vertical angles. In order to celebrate inclusivity and diversity, the club wants to use tiles that each represent the configuration of a unique angle found in traditional artworks from six different cultures around the world.

#### Task:
As part of the design team, you are tasked to calculate the measurements of the angles in each tile ensuring that they can fit together seamlessly around the circular centerpiece.

#### Diagram and Setup:
The diagram accompanying the task shows a circular centerpiece surrounded by spaces reserved for kite-shaped tiles. Each tile corner points toward or away from the center, imitating radial symmetry.

The description notes you can assume each pair of adjacent tiles around the circle share a vertex at the circle’s boundary and such vertices make an angle of 140˚ with the center of the circle.

### Problem Steps:

1. **Understanding Geometry in Context**: First, understand that since the vertex is making a 140˚ angle with the circle's center, the outside angle, which is complementary to the 140˚ angle in relation to a full 360˚ circle, is 360˚ - 140˚ = 220˚. However, since tiles are kite-shaped and symmetric, this angle needs to be divided into two for each kite. Thus, this becomes two angles of 110˚ each.

2. **Applying Cultural Angles**: Each culture’s traditional angle measures are as follows:
   - Culture A: 75˚
   - Culture B: 60˚
   - Culture C: 45˚
   - Culture D: 85˚
   - Culture E: 95˚
   - Culture F: 40˚ 
  
  Calculate how these might configure within the tiles making sure each tile’s angles add up to 360˚ and complementarity fit the 110˚ angle at the tile vertex pointing toward or away from the circle. These configurations must use two instances of the angle measurement from each culture per tile, representing vertical angles.

3. **Calculating the Kite Angles**:
   - You know each kite-shaped tile must have four angles adding up to 360˚.
   - With known angle measurements and vertical angle properties, calculate the unknown angles for each of the kite configurations ensuring each includes one of the cultural angles twice.

4. **Multi-Step Calculation**: Solve for the unknown angles in the tile designs, iteratively checking that adjacent and vertical properties hold, and the tiles can seamlessly fit together.

#### Conclusion:

Draft a brief report describing the calculations for each kite configuration, including sketches and cultural representations. This culturally responsive design not only celebrates diversity but also applies mathematical thinking to real-world problems, engaging students in geometry through art and community heritage.","Can you create a problem aligned to 7.G.B.5 that requires students conceptually understand this standard?

**Title:** Exploring Slices of a Cake-Shaped Box

**Introduction to the Problem:**

Imagine you have a big cake in the shape of a box (a rectangular prism), and you want to cut it to share with your friends. Depending on how you cut the cake, each slice or piece might look different. Let's explore how we can cut this box-shaped cake and find out what shapes we can see on the pieces!

**Materials Needed:**

- A rectangular box (to represent the cake) approximately the size of a shoebox.
- A piece of paper and a pencil to draw.
- Optionally, play-doh or clay can be used to create a model of a box.

**Problem Statement:**

1. **Vertical Slice (A straight cut from the top to the bottom):**
   - **Activity:** Pretend you are cutting the cake vertically from the top straight down to the bottom.
   - **Questions:** What shape will you see on the newly exposed surface? Draw it on your paper.
   
   > **Hint for Students:** Think about slicing straight down through the middle of a loaf of bread. What shape do the ends have?

2. **Horizontal Slice (A straight cut parallel to the bottom of the box):**
  - **Activity:** Now imagine slicing the cake horizontally, from one side to the other, but parallel to the table or the bottom of the box.
  - **Questions:** What shape will the top of each slice look like now? Draw this shape on your paper.
  
   > **Hint for Students:** If you can imagine a layer cake, how does it look from the top when you take off the top layer?

3. **Diagonal Slice (A slanting cut from the top corner across to the opposite bottom corner):**
   - **Activity:** This time, try imagining or slicing the cake diagonally from one top corner across to the opposite bottom corner.
   - **Questions:** What shape will be created on the face where you make this cut? Is it different from the first two shapes? Draw this shape on your paper.

   > **Hint for Students:** This is like cutting a sandwich diagonally from one corner to the other. What does the cut surface of the sandwich look like?

**Discussion Points:**

- After making each slice (cut), discuss:
  - Why is it important to know about these shapes?
  - In what real life could understanding these shapes be practical or useful?

**Summary:**

By completing this activity, you will understand how different cuts on a three-dimensional figure like a box can produce different two-dimensional shapes like rectangles or squares. Using these examples, you can better visualize geometric concepts in math and see how they apply to everyday objects!

**Extension Activity:**

Use play-doh or clay to create a model of the box and actually make these cuts. This hands-on activity may help solidify understanding of how two-dimensional shapes result from cuts in three-dimensional objects.","create a problem aligned to 7.G.A.3 in kid friendly language or broken down for ELL students to understand.

Problem:

Imagine you are a researcher who wants to know how many hours of sleep students in your school get each night. You want to make sure your findings are accurate, so you decide to survey a group of students.

Question:

If you survey 50 students, how can you be sure that your results are representative of the entire student body?

A) By surveying students from different grades.
B) By surveying students from different clubs and organizations.
C) By surveying students at different times of the day.
D) By surveying students from different neighborhoods.

Explanation:

For the results of a survey to be representative of the entire student body, the sample must be random. This means that every student in the school should have an equal chance of being selected for the survey.

Option A is incorrect because surveying students from different grades does not ensure that the sample is random. For example, if you only survey students in the 7th grade, your results may not accurately represent the sleep habits of students in other grades.

Option B is incorrect because surveying students from different clubs and organizations does not ensure that the sample is random. For example, if you only survey students who are in the school band, your results may not accurately represent the sleep habits of students who are not in the band.

Option C is incorrect because surveying students at different times of the day does not ensure that the sample is random. For example, if you only survey students during lunchtime, your results may not accurately represent the sleep habits of students who are not present during lunchtime.

Option D is incorrect because surveying students from different neighborhoods does not ensure that the sample is random. For example, if you only survey students who live in a certain neighborhood, your results may not accurately represent the sleep habits of students who live in other neighborhoods.

The correct answer is (E) By surveying a random sample of students from the entire student body. This ensures that every student in the school has an equal chance of being selected for the survey, making the results representative of the entire student body.

ELL Support:

For ELL students, it may be helpful to provide additional support and scaffolding to ensure they understand the concept of random sampling. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use visual aids: Use visual aids such as diagrams or pictures to help students understand the concept of random sampling. For example, you could show a picture of a jar filled with different colored marbles, and explain that each marble represents a student in the school. Then, show how a random sample of marbles can be selected from the jar to represent the entire jar.
2. Use real-world examples: Use real-world examples to help students understand the importance of random sampling. For example, you could explain that pollsters use random sampling to predict the outcome of elections. They survey a random sample of voters to get an idea of how everyone will vote.
3. Provide explicit vocabulary instruction: Provide explicit vocabulary instruction to ensure that ELL students understand key terms such as ""random,"" ""sample,"" and ""representative."" Use visual aids and examples to help students understand the meaning of these terms.
4. Use sentence frames: Use sentence frames to help students understand how to describe the concept of random sampling in their own words. For example, ""Random sampling means that every student in the school has an equal chance of being selected for the survey.""
5. Provide opportunities for practice: Provide opportunities for ELL students to practice using the language of random sampling. For example, you could have them work in small groups to create their own survey questions and select a random sample of students to survey.

#### Background for the Teacher:
This problem is designed to help students understand the concept of using a sample to make generalizations about a population. It simplifies the ideas of ""population,"" ""sample,"" and ""representative"" in a context familiar to students: ice cream preferences.

#### Student-friendly Problem Statement:

Imagine our school is curious about which flavor of ice cream is the favorite among all the students. Since we can't ask every single student (that's our ""population""), we decide to do a survey, which is basically like taking a quick peek by asking just some students (that's our ""sample"").

**Task:**
Your class has been picked to help with the survey. We want to make sure the students we ask are just like a tiny version of our whole school. That way, we can make a good guess about everyone's favorite ice cream.

1. **Choosing the Sample:**
   - **Option A:** We pick every third student who comes to the cafeteria at lunchtime.
   - **Option B:** We pick 20 students who are in the school ice cream club.

**Questions:**
- Which option (A or B) do you think is the best way to find out the favorite ice cream of all students at school? Why?
- What might be a problem if we choose the sample from the ice cream club?

#### Explanation for Students:
- **Option A** lets us talk to different kinds of students (not just ones who love ice cream a lot), so it might give us a better ""mini version"" of the whole school.
- **Option B** might only show us what kids who really love ice cream think, and that could be different from what all students think.

(A) 30 feet
(B) 60 feet
(C) 120 feet
(D) 240 feet

Answer: (B) 60 feet

Explanation:

The scale given is 1 inch : 20 feet, which means that 1 inch on the blueprint represents 20 feet in the actual park. Therefore, to find the actual length of the swimming pool, we need to multiply the length on the blueprint by the scale factor.

In this case, the length of the swimming pool on the blueprint is 6 inches, so the actual length is:

**Question:**

You have been given three sides of a triangle: 7 cm, 10 cm, and 15 cm.

1. Using a ruler and a protractor, construct a triangle with these side lengths. Describe the steps of your construction process.
2. Determine whether this set of side lengths form a unique triangle, more than one triangle, or no triangle at all. Explain your reasoning.

**Additional Instruction for Students:**

If you claim that no triangle can be constructed, explain why based on the properties and rules that pertain to triangles. If you successfully construct the triangle, describe the type of triangle it forms (e.g., scalene, isosceles, or equilateral).

**Answer Key:**

1. **Construction Steps:**
   - Draw a line segment 7 cm long.
   - At one endpoint of the line segment, use a compass to draw an arc 15 cm away from the point.
   - At the other endpoint, draw an arc 10 cm away from the point.
   - If the arcs intersect, connect the point of intersection to the endpoints of your original line segment to form a triangle.

2. **Determination and Reasoning:**
   - The given set does not form a triangle. To check whether three lengths can form a triangle, use the triangle inequality theorem which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - Here, 7 cm + 10 cm = 17 cm, which is greater than 15 cm, but 7 cm + 15 cm = 22 cm is not less than 10 cm, and 10 cm + 15 cm = 25 cm is not less than 7 cm. All conditions pass, however, a more detailed check (checking the largest side against the sum of the two smaller sides, i.e., 7 cm + 10 cm > 15 cm) reveals that this condition fails, hence, no triangle can be formed.

**Explanation:**
This type of question checks the students' understanding of both geometric construction and the application of the triangle inequality theorem.

Question: A farmer wants to build a circular vegetable garden with a path that is 2 meters wide around the edge. If the garden is going to have an area of 16π square meters, what is the diameter of the garden?

A) 4 meters
B) 6 meters
C) 8 meters
D) 10 meters

Solution:
Let's start by using the formula for the area of a circle: A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since the garden has an area of 16π square meters, we can set up the equation:

16π = πr^2

Now, we can divide both sides by π to get:

16 = r^2

Next, we can take the square root of both sides to get:

4 = r

Now, we know that the radius of the garden is 4 meters. We can use the formula for the diameter of a circle: d = 2r, where d is the diameter and r is the radius.

So, the diameter of the garden is:

d = 2r
= 2(4)
= 8 meters

Therefore, the correct answer is C) 8 meters.

Informal Derivation:
We can informally derive the relationship between the circumference and area of a circle by thinking about the definition of circumference. The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle. If we think about a circle with a radius of r, we can see that the distance around the circle is just 2πr, since we have to go around the circle twice to cover the entire distance.

Now, let's think about the area of the circle. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2. This formula makes sense, since the area of a circle is just the amount of space inside the circle, and the radius of the circle tells us how far from the center of the circle we have to go to reach the edge.

So, we can see that the circumference of a circle is just 2π times the radius of the circle, and the area of a circle is π times the radius squared. This means that if we know the circumference of a circle, we can easily find the radius by dividing the circumference by 2π. Then, we can use the radius to find the area of the circle by squaring it and multiplying by π.

This informal derivation helps us understand the relationship between the circumference and area of a circle, and it allows us to solve problems that involve both quantities.","please generate a possible quiz item aligned to common core SS for Math for 7.G.B.4

b) Calculate the circumference of the flower bed. Use the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.
c) Explain how the circumference formula (C = 2πr) relates to the area formula (A = πr²).

**Answer Key:**
a) Area = πr² = π(6²) = 36π square feet.
b) Circumference = 2πr = 2π(6) = 12π feet.
c) The relationship can be understood as follows: The circumference formula C = 2πr describes the distance around the circle. If this distance (or perimeter) were to be ""unrolled"" and shaped into a rectangle, the height would be the radius 'r' and the base would be 'r' units long (as C = 2πr, so half of it, πr, can be considered the base), making the 'rectangle' actually a rectangle-like stripe the length of the circle's circumference and width of the radius. The area of this ""rectangle"" would be the height (r) multiplied by πr, which is precisely the circumference formula rearranged, showing that the area of a rectangle derived by unrolling a circle’s circumference would be πr², explaining how these formulas are conceptually connected.","please generate a possible quiz item aligned to common core SS for Math for 7.G.B.4

D) 216 square feet

In addition, provide a brief explanation of how you derived the formula for the area of a circle.

Note: The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A represents the area, r is the radius, and π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159. To find the radius from the diameter, divide the diameter by 2. In this case, the radius would be 7 feet. Plug the radius value into the formula to find the area.

To derive the formula for the area of a circle, imagine dividing the circle into many small, congruent triangles with their vertices at the center of the circle. As the number of triangles increases, the shape becomes closer to a rectangle with a width equal to the circumference (2πr) and a height equal to the radius (r). Therefore, the area of the circle can be approximated as the area of the rectangle, which is the width multiplied by the height (2πr * r). This approximation becomes more accurate as the number of triangles increases, leading to the formula A = πr^2.","please generate a possible quiz item aligned to common core SS for Math for 7.G.B.4

7,"  Quiz Item:

A local amusement park has a game booth where players can win prizes by rolling a six-sided die. The die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 on its faces. The game booth attendant claims that the probability of winning a prize is 1/3 for each roll.

Your friend, who is a math whiz, decides to test this claim by rolling the die 20 times and keeping track of the numbers that come up. The results are as follows:

* Number 1: 4 times
* Number 2: 3 times
* Number 3: 5 times
* Number 4: 2 times
* Number 5: 3 times
* Number 6: 3 times

Use the data your friend collected to answer the following questions:

1. Develop a probability model for the game booth attendant's claim.
2. Calculate the probability of winning a prize for each roll of the die using the model you developed.
3. Compare the probabilities you calculated to the observed frequencies of each number.
4. Explain possible sources of discrepancy between the probabilities and observed frequencies.

A) Develop a probability model:
The probability model for the game booth attendant's claim is that each number on the die has an equal probability of being rolled, or 1/6.

B) Calculate the probability of winning a prize for each roll of the die:
Using the probability model, the probability of winning a prize for each roll of the die is 1/3, or approximately 0.33.

C) Compare the probabilities to the observed frequencies:
The observed frequencies do not match the probabilities predicted by the model. The observed frequencies are:

* Number 1: 4/20 = 0.2
* Number 2: 3/20 = 0.15
* Number 3: 5/20 = 0.25
* Number 4: 2/20 = 0.1
* Number 5: 3/20 = 0.15
* Number 6: 3/20 = 0.15

The observed frequencies are not close to the predicted probabilities of 1/3 for each number.

D) Explain possible sources of discrepancy:
There are several possible sources of discrepancy between the probabilities and observed frequencies:

1. Sample size: The sample size of 20 rolls may not be large enough to accurately reflect the true probabilities.
2. Bias: The die may be biased in some way, such as having uneven weights or a skewed shape, that affects the probability of certain numbers being rolled.
3. Human error: The game booth attendant or your friend may have made mistakes when rolling the die or recording the results.
4. Luck: It's possible that the observed frequencies are simply the result of luck, and the true probabilities are still close to 1/3.

Therefore, it's important to collect more data and analyze it further to determine the true source of the discrepancy.","please generate a possible quiz item aligned to common core SS for Math for 7.SP.C.7

**Question:**

A middle school's student council is organizing a game booth for their annual carnival. They have a game where contestants throw a dart at a board containing colored sections: 6 red, 3 blue, and 1 yellow. Assume each section is of equal size, and every throw is equally likely to land in any section.

**a)** Create a probability model for the colors a dart may land on, and calculate the following probabilities:
   - P(red)
   - P(blue)
   - P(yellow)
   - P(not yellow)

**b)** During the carnival, 100 people played this game, and the dart landed on the red section 55 times, blue 30 times, and yellow 15 times. Calculate the experimental probabilities based on this data:
   - P'(red)
   - P'(blue)
   - P'(yellow)

**c)** Compare the theoretical probabilities from part **a)** to the experimental probabilities from part **b)**. Discuss why there might be discrepancies between these probabilities.

---

**Answer Key:**

**a)** Total sections = 6 red + 3 blue + 1 yellow = 10 sections.
   - Theoretical Probability Model:
     - P(red) = Number of red sections / Total number of sections = 6/10 = 0.6
     - P(blue) = Number of blue sections / Total number of sections = 3/10 = 0.3
     - P(yellow) = Number of yellow sections / Total number of sections = 1/10 = 0.1
     - P(not yellow) = 1 - P(yellow) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9
  
**b)** 
   - Total plays = 100.
   - Experimental probabilities:
     - P'(red) = Number of times dart landed on red / Total number of plays = 55/100 = 0.55
     - P'(blue) = Number of times dart landed on blue / Total number of plays = 30/100 = 0.30
     - P'(yellow) = Number of times dart landed on yellow / Total number of plays = 15/100 = 0.15

**c)** 
   - Discrepancies between theoretical and experimental probabilities can be attributed to a number of factors:
     - **Sample size**: Although 100 plays is a decent number, it might still not be enough to perfectly reflect theoretical probabilities.
     - **Skill or bias in throwing**: Players might have developed a technique, or there might be a bias in how or where they throw the darts.
     - **Physical condition of the game board**: Imperfections or wear on certain colors could affect where the darts land.
     - **Random variation**: Even random processes will sometimes produce results that deviate from expected outcomes, especially over smaller numbers of trials.","please generate a possible quiz item aligned to common core SS for Math for 7.SP.C.7

7,"**Question:**  
Mr. Thompson's class decided to experiment with a standard six-sided die to understand probability better. They decided to roll the die 600 times and record the outcomes to estimate the probability of rolling a number less than 4 (that is, rolling a 1, 2, or 3). Based on probability theory, predict how many times the class should expect to roll a number less than 4 out of the 600 rolls.

**Multiple Choice Options:**
A) 100 times  
B) 200 times  
C) 300 times  
D) 400 times  

**Answer and Explanation:**  
The correct answer is **C) 300 times**.

**Explanation:**  
A standard die has six sides, with each side showing a distinct number from 1 to 6. Each number has an equal probability of 1/6 of being the result of a single roll. Therefore, the probability of rolling either a 1, 2, or 3 (three different numbers) in a single roll is the sum of their individual probabilities. This means:  
Probability(rolling a 1, 2, or 3) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.

Thus, each roll has a \( \frac{1}{2} \) (or 50%) chance of being a number less than 4. To find the expected number of times this event will occur in 600 rolls, we calculate:
\( 600 \times \frac{1}{2} = 300 \). 

This means that, based on probability, if the class were to roll the die 600 times, they should expect to get a number less than 4 around 300 times.","Please generate an item aligned to CCSS math 7.SP.C.6 for students to use to practice with.

#### Context:
Every year, your town hosts a cultural festival that celebrates diverse cultures and traditions. You are part of the planning committee, and this year, your task is to organize the layout of the festival booths. The location committee has proposed a linear arrangement according to each culture’s historical significance in the region. Additionally, you are asked to set up a special interactive booth where attendees can learn about different types of growth patterns (linear vs. Nonlinear) through the lens of festival booth setups.

#### Task:
1. **Linear Function Interpretation**: 
   The length of the walkway for the festival booths will be linearly increased as more cultural booths agree to participate. The relationship between the number of booths (n) and the total length of the walkway (L) in meters can be represented by the linear equation L = 10n + 20.

   - Predict how long the walkway will be if 15 booths participate.

2. **Nonlinear Function Example**:
   To make the festival engaging, a section for children’s games is being organized where each game booth will have a square playing area. The area of each game booth (A) as a function of its side length (s) in meters is given by A = s^2.
   
   - Explain why this function is nonlinear using three different side lengths (for example, 1m, 2m, and 3m) and calculate the area for each to illustrate your point.

3. **Interactive Booth Setup**:
   - Create a proposal for an engaging activity at the interactive booth that helps teach festival-goers about the difference between linear and nonlinear functions. Consider incorporating a creative use of cultural elements or patterns.

#### Goals:
- Enhance conceptual understanding of linear functions by relating parameters to real-life scenarios.

8," Sure! Here's a problem that aligns with 8.G.C.9 and is engaging, open, and culturally responsive:

Title: Designing a Community Garden

Background: Your community has received a grant to build a new community garden. The garden will have several raised beds for growing vegetables, a small pavilion for gatherings, and a water feature in the shape of a cone for aesthetic appeal. The garden committee has asked for your help in designing the water feature.

Problem:

1. The water feature will be in the shape of a cone with a height of 4 feet and a base radius of 2 feet. What is the volume of the cone? (Use 3.14 for π.)
2. The garden committee wants to fill the water feature with decorative stones. If the cone can hold 25 cubic feet of stones, how many bags of stones will they need to buy? Each bag of stones covers 1 cubic foot.
3. The garden committee has a budget of $200 for the stones. If each bag of stones costs $5, will they be able to afford enough stones to fill the water feature? Explain your reasoning.
4. The garden committee is also considering adding a fountain to the water feature. If the fountain will take up 2 cubic feet of space in the cone, how much volume will be left for the decorative stones?
5. Finally, the garden committee wants to know how much water the cone can hold. If 1 cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 pounds, how much will the cone hold?

Extension:

1. The garden committee is thinking of painting the outside of the water feature. If the cone is painted with stripes that are 6 inches wide, how many stripes will there be around the cone? (Assume the height of the cone is much greater than the width of the stripes.)
2. The garden committee is also considering adding lights to the water feature. If the lights are placed every 1 foot along the stripes, how many lights will there be?

This problem is engaging because it allows students to apply mathematical concepts to a real-world situation. It is open because it allows for multiple correct solutions and encourages students to think creatively. It is culturally responsive because it involves designing a community space that can be tailored to the needs and interests of the community.","Can you create a problem aligned to 8.G.C.9 that requires students conceptually understand this standard?

8,"**Problem Title: Community Water Tanks**

**Context:**
As part of a community development project, your local town council is evaluating different designs for new water tanks to support growing neighborhoods that honor culturally significant shapes and designs. The council is considering three designs based on the shapes of a cone, a cylinder, and a sphere, each of which symbolizes different cultural or natural elements revered in your community (e.g., a cone resembling a local mountain, a cylinder akin to ancient drum designs, and a sphere representing the earth).

**Problem:**
The council needs to choose which tank design to use based on a balance of cultural significance and practicality in terms of water capacity and land use. Each tank will have the same height of 10 meters. The radius for each option is also the same, at 5 meters. The council’s goal is to maximize water volume while considering cultural preferences and the visual impact on the landscape.

1. **Calculate the volume of each water tank design using the given dimensions:**
   - **Cone Volume Formula:** V = 1/3πr²h
   - **Cylinder Volume Formula:** V = πr²h
   - **Sphere Volume Formula:** V (for a full sphere) = 4/3πr³; Note: Assume the spherical tank would also be fully utilized despite the curved bottom.

2. **Reflection:** 
   - Discuss the advantages of each design concerning water volume and cultural significance.
   - Consider and describe how each design might blend with the local landscape and community values.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - Based on calculations and reflections, make a recommendation to the council on which design to choose. Consider other aspects such as the feasibility of construction, maintenance cost, and potential challenges each design might present.

4. **Extension Activity (Optional)**
   - Invite other students to design their water tank models, keeping in mind cultural themes and practicality. This is to promote creativity and integration of mathematical knowledge with cultural awareness.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply mathematical knowledge to solve real-world problems.
- Integrate cultural understanding into practical decision-making.
- Enhance problem-solving skills through quantitative analysis and qualitative reasoning.

8,"  Sure, here's a multi-step word problem aligned to 8.EE.C.7 that should be engaging and relevant for kids who are interested in culturally responsive, real-life scenarios:

Problem:

Step 1:
Amalia is a young entrepreneur who has started a small business selling traditional Mexican artisanal crafts at a local market. She has been doing well and has just received a large order from a boutique store in the city. However, she is worried that she won't be able to fulfill the order on time because she doesn't have enough money to buy all the materials she needs.

Step 2:
Amalia has approached her local community organization for a small business loan. They have agreed to lend her $500, but she needs to come up with a plan to pay it back. She has calculated that she will need to sell each craft item for $25 to make a profit and pay back the loan.

Step 3:
Amalia has also calculated that she will need to sell at least 20 craft items per week for the next 4 weeks to pay back the loan in time. She has 10 craft items already made, but she needs to make at least 10 more. She has decided to hire a part-time employee to help her with the production. The employee will cost $15 per hour, and Amalia plans to have them work for 2 hours per day, 5 days a week.

Question:
Will Amalia be able to pay back the loan in time? How many craft items will she need to sell in total?

Solution:

Step 1:
Let's first calculate how much money Amalia needs to make in total to pay back the loan:
$500 / $25 per item = 20 items

Step 2:
Amalia already has 10 items made, so she needs to make 10 more:
10 + 10 = 20 items

Step 3:
To calculate how many weeks Amalia has to pay back the loan, we can divide the total number of items she needs to sell by the number of items she can sell per week:
20 items / 20 items per week = 1 week

So, Amalia will be able to pay back the loan in 1 week.

Now, let's calculate how many craft items Amalia will need to sell in total:
20 items (per week) x 4 weeks = 80 items

Amalia will need to sell 80 craft items in total to pay back the loan.

Extension:
You can adjust the numbers in this problem to make it more challenging or to fit the needs of your students. For example, you could increase the amount of the loan, the cost of the materials, or the number of craft items Amalia needs to sell per week. You could also add additional variables, such as the cost of renting a table at the market or the cost of advertising her business.

Imagine you're investigating if the size of a student's sneaker affects how far they can jump. You and your classmates have gathered some information where everyone noted their shoe size and measured how far they could jump. Before diving into the problem, let's break down some important points:

1. **Bivariate Data**: This just means data with two variables. Here, the two variables are sneaker size and jump length.
2. **Linear Model**: This is a way to show the relationship between the two variables with a straight line.
3. **Slope**: This tells you how much one variable changes when the other variable changes. In simpler terms, it shows what happens to the jump length when the shoe size increases by one unit.
4. **Intercept**: This is where the line crosses the vertical axis when all other variables are zero. It tells you the starting point if the other variable is zero (though, in real life, having zero shoe size doesn’t make sense, but the math still uses it).

**The Problem:**

We want to use our data and the line we drew from it to understand more about sneaker sizes and jump length. We found out that the line equation from our data looks like this:

\[ \text{Jump Length} = 20 + 3 \times \text{Sneaker Size} \]

This equation helps us predict how far someone can jump based on their sneaker size.

**Task:**

1. **What does the slope tell us?**
   - Think about what the number 3 in our equation means for the jump length and sneaker size.

2. **What does the intercept tell us?**
   - Think about what the number 20 in our equation might represent when it comes to jump length.

3. **Calculating Jump Lengths:**
   - Use the equation to predict how far someone can jump if:
     - They wear a size 7 sneaker.
     - They wear a size 10 sneaker.

Question:
If Ava gives the plants 2 more hours of sunlight each day, how much taller will they be after 5 days?

Step 1: Look at the graph and find the slope of the line. The slope tells us how much the plant grows for each hour of sunlight.

Slope = 1.5 cm/hr

Step 2: Find the intercept of the line. The intercept tells us how tall the plant is when it gets 0 hours of sunlight.

Intercept = 5 cm

**Questions:**

1. How many more bacteria are there at the end of 3 hours compared to the beginning?
2. Write your answer from question 1 in scientific notation.
3. What is the factor by which the bacteria population increased over these 3 hours? (Hint: Divide the bacteria count at 3 hours by the initial count.)

**Steps to Solve:**

*A. Calculate the increase in the number of bacteria:*
- Initial number of bacteria = 3.5 x 10^6.
- Number of bacteria after 3 hours = 5.6 x 10^7.

To find the increase, subtract the initial number from the number after 3 hours:
Number of bacteria increase = (5.6 x 10^7) - (3.5 x 10^6).

*B. Convert the subtraction into compatible scientific notation:*
- Convert 3.5 x 10^6 to 0.35 x 10^7.
- Now subtract, keeping the power of 10 the same:
  Number of bacteria increase = (5.6 x 10^7) - (0.35 x 10^7) = 5.25 x 10^7.

*C. Finding the multiplication factor:*
- Multiply the factor = Final count / Initial count = (5.6 x 10^7) / (3.5 x 10^6).
- Convert 3.5 x 10^6 to 0.35 x 10^7 to match the exponents:
  Multiply the factor = (5.6 x 10^7) / (0.35 x 10^7) = 16.

A scientist is studying the growth of a giant sequoia tree. She measures the tree's height and finds that it is approximately 85 meters tall. She also measures the diameter of the tree's trunk and finds that it is approximately 3.5 meters.

The scientist wants to calculate the volume of the tree's trunk. She knows that the formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2h, where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height.

First, the scientist needs to convert the diameter of the trunk from meters to centimeters. She knows that there are 100 centimeters in 1 meter, so she multiplies the diameter by 100 to get 350 centimeters.

Next, she needs to convert the height of the tree from meters to centimeters. She knows that there are 100 centimeters in 1 meter, so she multiplies the height by 100 to get 8500 centimeters.

Now, she can use the formula V = πr^2h to calculate the volume of the tree's trunk. She plugs in the values for r (350 centimeters) and h (8500 centimeters) and gets V = π(350)^2(8500) = 3.57 x 10^10 cubic centimeters.

Finally, the scientist wants to express the volume in a more manageable unit, such as cubic meters. She knows that there are 1000 cubic centimeters in 1 cubic meter, so she divides the volume by 1000 to get 3.57 x 10^9 cubic meters.

### Question:

During a geometry project, you are given two parallel lines, line A and line B. A transversal line, line T, intersects line A at point P and line B at point Q. 

The angles formed at point P are as follows:
- \( \angle 1 = 110^\circ \) (interior angle on the left side)
- \( \angle 2 \) (interior angle on the right side)
- \( \angle 3 = 70^\circ \) (exterior angle on the left side)

Using what you know about the relationships between the angles formed when parallel lines are cut by a transversal, solve for \( \angle 2 \), the interior angle on the right side of point P. Then, write an informal argument explaining why \( \angle 2 \) has the value that you found.

### Answer:
- **Calculation of \( \angle 2 \):**
  \( \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ \)

- **Informal Argument:**
  When parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, \( \angle 2 \) (an interior angle on the right side of line A at point P), corresponds to \( \angle 3 \) (an exterior angle on the left side of line B at point Q). Since both line A and line B are parallel, and line T is their transversal, the measurement of the interior angle at one point on a line has a corresponding equal exterior angle measurement on the opposite side of the other line. Thus, since \( \angle 3 \) is \( 70^\circ \), \( \angle 2 \) also measures \( 70^\circ \). This equality demonstrates an essential property of parallel lines cut by a transversal where corresponding angles are always equal, helping ensure the consistency of angle measurements in geometric constructs involving parallel lines and transversals.","please generate a possible quiz item aligned to common core SS for Math for 8.G.A.5

A) 60 degrees
B) 75 degrees
C) 90 degrees
D) 120 degrees

Alignment to 8.G.A.5:

This quiz item aligns to standard 8.G.A.5 as it requires students to use informal arguments and the angle-angle criterion for similarity of triangles to solve the problem. By using the transversal property, students can argue that the sum of the angles in the triangle formed by AC, m, and n is 180 degrees, and therefore, angle 3 measures 90 degrees. This problem also reinforces the concept of parallel lines and their properties.

Possible Solution:

One possible solution is as follows:

1. Draw a straight line through point C, extending line m.
2. Draw a straight line through point A, extending line n.
3. Label the intersection point of the two lines as point B.
4. Use the transversal property to argue that the sum of the angles in the triangle formed by AC, m, and n is 180 degrees.
5. Conclude that angle 3 measures 90 degrees.

Informal Argument:

The transversal property states that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. By drawing a straight line through point C, extending line m, and a straight line through point A, extending line n, we create a triangle with angles 1, 2, and 3. Since the sum of the angles in this triangle is 180 degrees, we can conclude that angle 3 measures 90 degrees. This argument can be reinforced by pointing out that the angle-angle criterion for similarity of triangles also supports the conclusion that angle 3 measures 90 degrees.","please generate a possible quiz item aligned to common core SS for Math for 8.G.A.5

**Instructions:**
For each scenario, state whether it represents a function or not and justify your decision based on the definition of a function.

**Responses for Students to Consider:**

- **Scenario 1:** This scenario is a function. Each menu item (input) has exactly one price (output), making it a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output.

- **Scenario 2:** This scenario is **not** a function. The name ""Whiskers"" is assigned to more than one cat. Therefore, some inputs (cat names) do not have precisely one corresponding output (specific cat), violating the definition of a function where each input should have exactly one output.

- **Scenario 3:** This scenario is a function. Each unique book identification number (input) corresponds to one specific book (output), even though the same book can be checked out multiple times. The function assigns each ID number to exactly one output (the book it identifies), despite the book being borrowed multiple times.

- **Scenario 4:** This scenario is **not** a function. The input (movie title) results in multiple outputs (different showtimes), suggesting that a single input does not uniquely determine one output.

HS,"  Problem: ""Designing a Sustainable Community Garden""

In a small town, a group of residents have come together to create a community garden. They have a plot of land that they want to divide into sections to grow different types of crops. The garden will be used to provide fresh produce to local families in need and to serve as an educational tool for local schools.

The group has decided to divide the plot into 6 sections: 4 sections for growing vegetables, 1 section for fruit trees, and 1 section for a pollinator garden. They have also decided that each section should be approximately equal in size.

Your task is to help the group design the garden by dividing the plot into 6 equal sections. However, there are a few constraints that need to be considered:

1. The plot is rectangular in shape and measures 200 feet by 100 feet.
2. The sections should be separated by pathways that are at least 5 feet wide.
3. The fruit tree section should be at least 25 feet by 25 feet in size to accommodate the mature size of the trees.
4. The pollinator garden should be at least 20 feet by 20 feet in size to provide enough space for a variety of plants.
5. The remaining 4 sections for vegetables should be approximately equal in size.

Using the standard HSA-APR.D.6, rewrite the given expressions in different forms to find the dimensions of each section.

Example 1:
The area of the plot is given by the expression:

200 feet x 100 feet = 20,000 square feet

Rewrite this expression in the form q(x) + r(x)/b(x), where a(x), b(x), q(x), and r(x) are polynomials. In this case, we can rewrite the expression as:

20,000 square feet = 100 feet x 200 feet

= 100 feet x (200 feet - 5 feet) + 5 feet x 200 feet

= 100 feet x 195 feet + 5 feet x 200 feet

= 19,500 square feet + 10,000 square feet

= 29,500 square feet

Example 2:
The area of each vegetable section is given by the expression:

29,500 square feet / 4 = 7,375 square feet

Rewrite this expression in the form q(x) + r(x)/b(x). In this case, we can rewrite the expression as:

7,375 square feet = 7,000 square feet + 375 square feet

= 7,000 square feet + (375 square feet - 25 square feet) + 25 square feet

= 7,000 square feet + 350 square feet + 25 square feet

= 7,350 square feet + 25 square feet

Example 3:
The area of the fruit tree section is given by the expression:

25 feet x 25 feet = 625 square feet

Rewrite this expression in the form q(x) + r(x)/b(x). In this case, we can rewrite the expression as:

625 square feet = 25 feet x 25 feet

= 25 feet x (25 feet - 5 feet) + 5 feet x 25 feet

= 25 feet x 20 feet + 5 feet x 25 feet

= 500 square feet + 125 square feet

= 625 square feet

Example 4:
The area of the pollinator garden is given by the expression:

20 feet x 20 feet = 400 square feet

Rewrite this expression in the form q(x) + r(x)/b(x). In this case, we can rewrite the expression as:

400 square feet = 20 feet x 20 feet

= 20 feet x (20 feet - 5 feet) + 5 feet x 20 feet

= 20 feet x 15 feet + 5 feet x 20 feet

= 300 square feet + 100 square feet

= 400 square feet

Now, use the rewritten expressions to calculate the dimensions of each section:

1. Vegetable sections: 7,350 square feet + 25 square feet = 7,375 square feet (width) x 100 feet (length) = 737.5 feet x 100 feet
2. Fruit tree section: 625 square feet (width) x 25 feet (length) = 25 feet x 25 feet
3. Pollinator garden: 400 square feet (width) x 20 feet (length) = 20 feet x 20 feet

Pathways:

* Width: 5 feet
* Length: 200 feet (for the 4 vegetable sections) + 25 feet (for the fruit tree section) + 20 feet (for the pollinator garden) = 245 feet

The dimensions of each section are:

1. Vegetable sections: 737.5 feet x 100 feet
2. Fruit tree section: 25 feet x 25 feet
3. Pollinator garden: 20 feet x 20 feet
4. Pathways: 5 feet x 245 feet

The garden design meets all the constraints and provides approximately equal-sized sections for each crop. The fruit tree section is large enough to accommodate mature fruit trees, and the pollinator garden is large enough to provide a variety of plants. The pathways are wide enough to allow for easy access and maintenance.

This problem aligns with the standard HSA-APR.D.6 by requiring students to rewrite simple rational expressions in different forms to solve a real-world problem.

Problem: ""Cultural Feast""

In a small town, there are several cultural festivals that take place throughout the year. At each festival, the town's residents come together to share a meal that represents their heritage. The town council has asked for your help in determining the cost of each meal per person for the upcoming Cultural Feast.

The council has provided you with the following recipe for the Cultural Feast meal:

Meal cost (in dollars) = (3x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x + 2) / (x^2 + 2x + 3)

where x represents the number of people attending the feast.

The council has also given you the following information about the feast:

* The degree of the numerator represents the total cost of ingredients, labor, and other expenses.
* The degree of the denominator represents the number of people attending the feast.
* The town wants to keep the cost per person as low as possible while still providing a delicious and culturally significant meal.

Your task is to rewrite the meal cost as a mixed rational expression in the form q(x) + r(x)/b(x), where the degree of r(x) is less than the degree of b(x). This will help the town council better understand the cost per person for the Cultural Feast.

To make this problem engaging, open, and culturally responsive, consider the following:

HS,"### Problem: Community Garden Project

#### Context:
The local community has embarked on a garden project. To determine the layout, they've decided to divide the total area into various sections, each for different types of plants. Mariana, one of the community leaders and a skilled mathematician, is in charge of optimizing the use of space and resources. Based on her research, Mariana formulates the ratio of the area allotted for vegetables to the total area as a rational expression.

#### Rational Expression:
The expression representing the situation is:
\[ \frac{6x^3 + 13x^2 - 28x}{2x^2 - 5x - 12} \]

#### Task:
As a student helping Mariana, your task is to:

1. **Rewrite the expression**: Convert the given rational expression into the form \( q(x) + \frac{r(x)}{b(x)} \) using polynomial long division.
2. **Interpret the results**: Explain what your results signify about the layout and design of the garden.
3. **Cultural Response**: Reflect on how organizing the community garden might symbolically represent the community's values and diversity.

#### Steps to Complete the Task:

##### **Step 1: Performing Polynomial Long Division**
1. *Set up the division*: Place \(6x^3 + 13x^2 - 28x\) (dividend) inside the division symbol and \(2x^2 - 5x - 12\) (divisor) outside.
2. *Divide the leading terms*: Divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor to find the first term of the quotient. For example, \( \frac{6x^3}{2x^2} = 3x \).
3. *Multiply and subtract*: Multiply the entire divisor by 3x and subtract the result from the original polynomial. Bring down the next term if necessary.
4. *Repeat the process* until the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor.

##### **Step 2: Interpreting the Results**
- Use the quotient and remainder to explain how the space allocation in the garden might be optimized. For instance, if the quotient represents the main sections for vegetables and the remainder the smaller specialized plots, discuss how this could be beneficial.

##### **Step 3: Reflect on Cultural Significance**
- Reflect on the importance of the community garden in bringing different parts of the community together, representing a mixture of cultures through plant choice, and how space allocation might allow for both individual and communal areas that reflect the community’s diverse nature.

HS,"### Problem: Community Forest Restoration

**Context:**
In a small community, efforts are being made to restore a forest damaged by industrial pollution. The community has started a project to plant trees to sequester carbon dioxide – a principal greenhouse gas – to rehabilitate the environment. The growth of trees follows an exponential model based on the amount of carbon sequestered.

**Problem Statement:**
The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that trees can sequester (capture and store) from the atmosphere is proportional to their biomass, which grows exponentially over time as described by the equation:
\[ C(t) = C_0 \cdot e^{rt} \]
where:
- \( C(t) \) is the amount of CO2 sequestered in metric tons after \( t \) years,
- \( C_0 \) is the initial amount of CO2 sequestered at \( t = 0 \),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate of sequestration,
- \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm.

The community hopes to sequester at least 500 metric tons of CO2 within the next 10 years to meet environmental standards set by the government and support local wildlife resurgence.

**Given:**
- The initial amount of sequestered CO2 (when t=0) is 50 metric tons.
- The annual growth rate \( r \) is estimated at 0.045.

**Tasks:**

1. Calculate how much CO2 the trees will sequester in 10 years.
2. Determine the number of years necessary for the community’s forest to sequester a total of 1000 metric tons of CO2.

**Solving Task 1:**
Using the formula for exponential growth:
\[ C(10) = 50 \cdot e^{0.045 \times 10} \]
Calculate the approximate value of \( C(10) \) using the value of \( e^{0.45} \). 

**Solving Task 2:**
To find the number of years \( t \) for 1000 metric tons:
\[ 1000 = 50 \cdot e^{0.045t} \]
Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:
\[ \ln(1000) = \ln(50) + \ln(e^{0.045t}) \]
\[ \ln(1000) - \ln(50) = 0.045t \]
Solve for \( t \).

**Extensions and Discussion:**
- Discuss the environmental impact of CO2 sequestration and how projects like these can affect the local and global ecosystems.
- Research other biological or non-biological methods to capture and store CO2 and compare them to forest restoration.
- Reflect on how the community can play a role in global efforts to combat climate change.

Problem:

The traditional art of henna tattooing has been a significant part of many cultures for centuries. Henna artists use a mixture of henna powder, lemon juice, and sugar to create intricate designs on the skin. The process of applying henna is time-consuming, and the design's longevity depends on several factors, including the quality of the henna mixture, the thickness of the application, and the aftercare of the design.

A henna artist is preparing for a cultural festival and wants to create a unique and intricate design for the event. She has a limited amount of henna mixture and wants to make sure that the design lasts for the entire festival. She knows that the henna mixture's potency decreases exponentially over time.

Task:

(a) The artist has 50 grams of henna mixture and wants to create a design that will last for 8 days. If the potency of the henna mixture decreases by 20% every day, how much henna mixture will she have left after 8 days?

(b) The artist also wants to create a smaller design that will last for 4 days. If she uses 20 grams of henna mixture for the smaller design, what will be the potency of the remaining henna mixture after 4 days?

(c) The artist wants to create a third design that will last for 12 days. If she uses 30 grams of henna mixture for this design, what will be the potency of the remaining henna mixture after 12 days?

(d) The artist is planning to apply the henna mixture in different thicknesses to create different shades and textures in the design. If she applies the henna mixture at a thickness of 2 mm for the first design, how much henna mixture will she need for a smaller design that requires a thickness of 1 mm?

(e) The artist wants to create a design that will last for 20 days. If she uses 40 grams of henna mixture for this design, what will be the potency of the remaining henna mixture after 20 days?

In this problem, students must apply the inverse relationship between exponents and logarithms to solve real-world problems involving henna tattooing, a cultural practice that is significant to many communities around the world. The problem requires students to use mathematical concepts to model the decay of the henna mixture's potency over time and to determine the amount of henna mixture needed for different designs and time periods.

Problem:

A group of friends want to play a game of laser tag. The cost of renting the equipment is $15 per person, and they need to pay a deposit of $50. If they have 20 people in the group, how much will it cost in total?

To solve this problem, students can use complex numbers and the properties mentioned in the standard. Here's one way to approach it:

Let's say the cost of renting the equipment for one person is represented by the complex number $15 + 0i$. The deposit of $50 can be represented by the complex number $50 + 0i$.

To find the total cost for 20 people, we can multiply the cost of renting the equipment by 20:

$15 + 0i \times 20 = 300 + 0i$

Now, we need to add the deposit to the total cost:

$300 + 0i + 50 + 0i = 350 + 0i$

Using the commutative property, we can rewrite the expression as:

$350 + 0i = 0i + 350$

Simplifying, we get:

$350 + 0i = 350$

So, the total cost for the group of 20 people to play laser tag will be $350.

To support diverse learners in the resource room, you can provide different levels of complexity for this problem. For example:

1. Simplified version:
Use only positive integers and ignore the imaginary part of the complex numbers. In this case, the cost of renting the equipment would be $15 x 20 = 300, and the total cost would be $300 + $50 = $350.
2. Moderate version:
Use complex numbers with only positive real parts. In this case, the cost of renting the equipment would be represented by the complex number $15 + 0i$, and the deposit would be represented by the complex number $50 + 0i$. Students would need to multiply and add these complex numbers to find the total cost.
3. Advanced version:
Use complex numbers with both positive and negative real parts. In this case, the cost of renting the equipment would be represented by the complex number $15 + 0i$, and the deposit would be represented by the complex number $50 + 0i$. Students would need to multiply and add these complex numbers, and then simplify the expression to find the total cost.

By providing different levels of complexity, you can accommodate diverse learners and help them build confidence in working with complex numbers.","Create a math problem for HSN-CN.A.2. This problem will need to be simplified to support diverse learners in the resource room.

1. Pay a flat fee of $150 for the booth rental.
2. Pay a $50 setup fee and then an additional $10 for each hour the booth is in operation.

Emily estimates that she will run her booth for a certain number of hours, \( h \). She would like to determine for how many hours she needs to run the booth for the second option to be more cost-effective than the first.

**Create an equation to determine the number of hours Emily must run her booth under the second payment option to make it cheaper than the first option.**

---

We need to set up the costs for both options and find the point at which the cost of the second option is less than the cost of the first.

1. **Cost of the first option (Option 1):** This cost is a constant, \( C_1 = 150 \).

2. **Cost of the second option (Option 2):** This cost is a function of the number of hours the booth is run, \( h \). The equation for this cost is \( C_2 = 50 + 10h \).

We need to find out when Option 2 becomes cheaper than Option 1, which can be described by the inequality:
\[ 50 + 10h < 150 \]

Solving this inequality will give the point at which it becomes cheaper for Emily to choose the second option based on the number of hours, \( h \).

**Solution:**

\[ 50 + 10h < 150 \]
Subtract 50 from both sides:
\[ 10h < 100 \]
Divide both sides by 10:
\[ h < 10 \]

**Interpretation:**

Emily should run her booth for fewer than 10 hours for the second rental option ($50 setup fee + $10 per hour) to be more cost-effective than the first option (flat $150 fee). 

Thus, the inequality \( h < 10 \) helps Emily determine the upper limit of operating hours for which the second rental option is advantageous.","Create a math problem that uses HSA-CED.A.1.

HS," A small business sold a total of 120 items of clothing last month, and they made a profit of $1500. The profit made from selling each t-shirt is $10, and the profit made from each sweater is $20. The business sold 2 times as many t-shirts as sweaters last month. Create an equation to represent the number of t-shirts (t) and sweaters (s) sold last month and solve it to find out how many of each item the business sold. (Use HSA-CED.A.1 to create and solve the equation.)

Let t be the number of t-shirts and s be the number of sweaters. We are given the following information:

t + s = 120 (total number of items sold)
10t + 20s = 1500 (total profit)
t = 2s (2 times as many t-shirts as sweaters)

Now, we can use substitution to solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for t:

t = 2s
t + s = 120
2s + s = 120
3s = 120
s = 40

Now that we have the number of sweaters, we can find the number of t-shirts:

t = 2s
t = 2 * 40
t = 80

So, the small business sold 80 t-shirts and 40 sweaters last month.","Create a math problem that uses HSA-CED.A.1.

HS,"### Problem Statement:
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x - 5 = 10 \) and explain each step following the equality of numbers asserted at the previous step.

### Solution Process:

**Step 1: Add 5 to both sides of the equation.**  
The original equation is \( 3x - 5 = 10 \). To isolate the term containing \( x \), we add 5 to each side:
\[ 3x - 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 \]
\[ 3x = 15 \]  
**Explanation:** Adding the same number to both sides of an equation keeps the equality balanced. Here, adding 5 to each side cancels the -5 on the left, leaving \( 3x \) alone.

**Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3.**  
Now we need to solve for \( x \) by getting it alone on one side:
\[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ x = 5 \]  
**Explanation:** Dividing both sides of an equation by the same nonzero number keeps the equation balanced. By dividing by 3, we isolate \( x \) by eliminating the coefficient of 3. 

### Justification of the Solution Method:
Each arithmetical operation performed (addition and division) follows from the properties of equality, ensuring the balance in the equation is maintained. By systematically isolating \( x \), we derived its value logically from the original equation, justifying that \( x = 5 \) is a solution.

1. **Addition Property of Equality:** Indicates that if \( a = b \), then \( a + c = b + c \) for any \( c \). This justifies adding 5 on both sides in step 1.

2. **Division Property of Equality:** Indicates that if \( a = b \) and \( c \neq 0 \), then \( \frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{c} \). This justifies dividing both sides by 3 in step 2.

We have followed each operation by explaining and ensuring they result from the properties of equality confirming the solution \( x = 5 \) follows genuinely from the initial equation condition. This systematic approach shows that assuming the original equation \( 3x - 5 = 10 \) has a solution, and by performing equal operations on both sides, we retain equality while finding the solution.","Create a math problem that uses HSA-REI.A.1.

Solve the following equation:

3(x - 2) + 1 = 2(x + 1)

Explain each step in solving this equation, starting from the assumption that the original equation has a solution. Here's an example of how you might justify your solution method:

Step 1: Distribute the 3 and the 2 on both sides of the equation to get:

3x - 6 + 1 = 2x + 2

Step 2: Simplify the left side of the equation:

3x - 5 = 2x + 2

Step 3: Subtract 2x from both sides to isolate x:

3x - 2x - 5 = 2x - 2x + 2

This simplifies to:

x - 5 = 2

Step 4: Add 5 to both sides to solve for x:

x - 5 + 5 = 2 + 5

This simplifies to:

x = 7

Therefore, the solution to the equation is x = 7. To justify this solution method, we can explain that each step follows from the equality of numbers asserted at the previous step, starting from the assumption that the original equation has a solution.

Step 1: Write the equation as follows:

2x + 5 = 11

Step 2: Subtract 5 from both sides to get:

2x = 6

Step 3: Divide both sides by 2 to get:

x = 3

Now, students need to justify their solution method by explaining why each step follows from the equality of numbers asserted at the previous step, starting from the assumption that the original equation has a solution.

Here's a possible justification:

Step 1: The equation 2x + 5 = 11 is given. We assume that it has a solution, which means that there exists a value of x that makes the equation true.

Step 2: We subtract 5 from both sides to get 2x = 6. This step follows from the equality of numbers asserted at the previous step, since we know that 2x + 5 = 11, and subtracting 5 from both sides does not change the truth of the equation.

Step 3: We divide both sides of the equation 2x = 6 by 2 to get x = 3. This step also follows from the equality of numbers asserted at the previous step, since we know that 2x = 6, and dividing both sides by 2 does not change the truth of the equation.

Therefore, the solution to the equation 2x + 5 = 11 is x = 3, which we have justified by explaining why each step follows from the equality of numbers asserted at the previous step, starting from the assumption that the original equation has a solution.","Create a math problem that uses HSA-REI.A.1.

HS," Problem:

Given two points A(cos(x)) and B(cos(y)) on the unit circle, where x and y are angles in the same quadrant. Let C be the point on the circle such that AC is a diameter of the circle. If D is the point on the circle such that angle ACD = 90 degrees, and angle DCB = z, prove the formula for cos(x - y) using the right triangle formed by AC, CD, and CB.

Solution:

In the right triangle formed by AC, CD, and CB, we have:
cos(x) = AC/AC (by definition of cosine)
cos(y) = CB/AC (by definition of cosine)

We want to find the length of CD, which is equal to sin(x) by definition of sine.

Since AC is a diameter, angle ACD is a right angle, and angle DCB = z, we can use the tangent addition formula:

tan(x + z) = (sin(x + z))/cos(x + z) = (sin(x)cos(z) + cos(x)sin(z))/cos(x)cos(z)

But since angle ACD is a right angle, tan(x + z) = sin(x)/cos(x) (by definition of tangent). Therefore,

sin(x)/cos(x) = (sin(x)cos(z) + cos(x)sin(z))/cos(x)cos(z)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

sin(x)cos(z) + cos(x)sin(z) = sin(x)

Since sin(z) = CD/1 (by definition of sine), we have:

sin(x)cos(z) + cos(x)CD = sin(x)

Solving for CD, we get:

CD = sin(x) - sin(x)cos(z)/cos(x)

Now, we can use the subtraction formula for sine:

sin(x - y) = sin(x)cos(y) - cos(x)sin(y)

Since cos(y) = CB/AC, we have:

sin(x - y) = sin(x)CB/AC - cos(x)sin(y)/AC

Multiplying both sides by AC, we get:

ACsin(x - y) = sin(x)CB - cos(x)sin(y)

Since CD = sin(x) - sin(x)cos(z)/cos(x), we have:

ACsin(x - y) = sin(x)(AC - CD)

Dividing both sides by AC, we get:

sin(x - y) = sin(x)(1 - CD/AC)

Since CD/AC = sin(x - y)/sin(x), we have:

sin(x - y) = sin(x)(1 - sin(x - y)/sin(x))

Simplifying, we get:

sin(x - y) = sin(x) - sin(x - y)

Adding sin(x - y) to both sides, we get:

2sin(x - y) = sin(x)

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

sin(x - y) = sin(x)/2

Therefore, cos(x - y) = sqrt(1 - sin^2(x - y)) = sqrt(1 - (sin(x)/2)^2) = sqrt(1 - sin^2(x)/4)

This is the formula for cos(x - y) in terms of sin(x).","Create a math problem that uses HSF-TF.C.9.

### Problem:

A ship leaves a harbor and sails 12 km north. It then turns 45 degrees and sails an additional 8 km. Find the shortest distance from the initial point of departure to the ship's final position. Assume the direction after turning is 45 degrees east of north.

### Solution:

#### Step 1: Express the problem using trigonometric functions.
Since the ship sails north and then makes a 45-degree turn eastwards, we can model the ship's movement vectorially using the coordinates system.

1. The first leg of the journey is 12 km north, which can be described by the vector \(\mathbf{v}_1 = (0, 12)\).
2. The second leg is 8 km to the northeast (45 degrees east of north). To express this vector \(\mathbf{v}_2\) using trigonometric functions, recall that:
   - \( \cos(45^\circ) = \sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)
   - Therefore, \(\mathbf{v}_2 = (8\cos(45^\circ), 8\sin(45^\circ)) = (4\sqrt{2}, 4\sqrt{2})\).

#### Step 2: Find the resultant vector.
The resultant vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is the sum of \(\mathbf{v}_1\) and \(\mathbf{v}_2\):
\[ \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2 = (0 + 4\sqrt{2}, 12 + 4\sqrt{2}) = (4\sqrt{2}, 12 + 4\sqrt{2}) \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the magnitude of the resultant vector.
To find the shortest distance from the starting point to the final position of the ship, compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{v}\):
\[ \|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(4\sqrt{2})^2 + (12 + 4\sqrt{2})^2} \]
\[ = \sqrt{32 + (16 + 96 + 32)} \]
\[ = \sqrt{32 + 144} \]
\[ = \sqrt{176} \]
\[ = 4\sqrt{11} \text{ km} \]

### Conclusion:
The shortest distance from the starting point to the ship's final position is \(4\sqrt{11}\) km.

#### Using HSF-TF.C.9 Standard:
Note, this problem used the addition formula in breaking down the coordinates for \(\mathbf{v}_2\) after a 45-degree shift. By utilizing the formulas for sine and cosine at common angles and understanding vector addition, we can solve practical navigation-related problems like this. This aligns with the competencies described in HSF-TF.C.9 as it blends geometric modeling with trigonometry and proofs using trigonometric identities and formulas.","Create a math problem that uses HSF-TF.C.9.

HS,"  Problem:

A circle passes through the points (2, 3), (5, 7), and (1, -4). Find the center and radius of the circle using the Pythagorean Theorem and completing the square.

Solution:

First, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the radius of the circle:

r = √(5-2)² + (7-3)² + (1-2)² + (4-3)²

r = √(3² + 4² + (-1)² + (-2)²)

r = √(9 + 16 + 1 + 4)

r = √20

Now, we can complete the square to find the center of the circle:

(x - h)² + (y - k)² = r²

(x - h)² + (y - k)² = 20

We can factor the left-hand side of the equation:

(x - h)² + (y - k)² = (x - h + 5)(x - h - 5) + (y - k + 3)(y - k - 3)

(x - h + 5)(x - h - 5) + (y - k + 3)(y - k - 3) = 20

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

(x - h + 5)(x - h - 5) + (y - k + 3)(y - k - 3) = 20

x² - 10x + 25 + y² - 12y + 35 = 20

x² - 10x + 25 + y² - 12y + 35 = 20

Moving all terms to the left-hand side and simplifying, we get:

x² - 10x + 25 + y² - 12y + 35 - 20 = 0

x² - 10x + 25 + y² - 12y + 15 = 0

Now, we can factor the left-hand side of the equation:

(x - 5)(x - 5) + (y - 3)(y - 3) = 0

(x - 5)(x - 5) = (y - 3)(y - 3)

x - 5 = ±(y - 3)

x = 5 ± (y - 3)

Now, we can substitute y = 3 to find the center of the circle:

x = 5 ± (3 - 3)

x = 5 ± 0

x = 5

So, the center of the circle is (5, 3).

Therefore, the equation of the circle is:

(x - 5)² + (y - 3)² = 20

This equation can be derived from the Pythagorean Theorem and completing the square.","Create a math problem that uses HSG-GPE.A.1.

Find the center and radius of the circle described by the equation:

(x² - 6x + 9) + y² + 8y + 9 = 9 + 9
(x-3)² + y² + 8y + 9 = 18

Now, complete the square for the y-term by adding and subtracting (4)² = 16:

(x-3)² + (y² + 8y + 16) = 18 + 16
(x-3)² + (y+4)² = 34

### Problem:

Given the points A = (3, 4) and B = (-1, 2), find the equation of the circle for which segment AB is a diameter.

### Solution:

**Step 1: Find the midpoint of segment AB.**  
This midpoint will be the center of the circle since the segment AB is given as a diameter. Using the midpoint formula:
\[ M(x, y) = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right) \]
\[ M(x, y) = \left(\frac{3 - 1}{2}, \frac{4 + 2}{2}\right) \]
\[ M(x, y) = (1, 3) \]

**Step 2: Calculate the radius of the circle.**  
The radius is half the length of the diameter (distance between points A and B). Using the distance formula:
\[ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{((-1) - 3)^2 + (2 - 4)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-2)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \]
Thus, the radius \( r \) of the circle is \( \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{2} = \sqrt{5} \).

**Step 3: Derive the equation of the circle.**  
Using the standard form of the circle's equation \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\) where \((h, k)\) is the center and \(r\) is the radius, substitute \(h = 1\), \(k = 3\), and \(r = \sqrt{5}\):
\[ (x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = (\sqrt{5})^2 \]
\[ (x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 5 \]

Hence, the equation of the circle with diameter AB is \( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 5 \).","Create a math problem that uses HSG-GPE.A.1.

Let A be the event that the first card is a heart, and B be the event that the second card is a diamond.

First, find P(A): The probability that the first card is a heart is 13/52 since there are 13 hearts in the deck of 52 cards.

Next, find P(B): Since one card has been removed from the deck, there are now 51 cards left. The probability that the second card is a diamond is 13/51 since there are still 13 diamonds in the deck.

Now, find P(A and B): This is the probability that both events A and B occur, i.e., the first card is a heart and the second card is a diamond. Since the cards are drawn without replacement, this probability is (13/52) * (12/51), as there are 12 diamonds left after the first heart is drawn.

A bag contains 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 3 green balls. Two balls are drawn at random from the bag. What is the probability that both balls are the same color?

To solve this problem, we can use the Addition Rule, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B), where A and B are the events that the first ball is red and the second ball is red, respectively.

First, we need to find the probability of each event:

P(A) = 5/15 = 1/3
P(B) = 5/15 = 1/3

Next, we need to find the probability of the intersection of A and B, which is the event that both balls are red:

P(A and B) = 5/15 × 4/14 = 1/6

Now we can apply the Addition Rule:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B)
= 1/3 + 1/3 – 1/6
= 2/3

Therefore, the probability that both balls are the same color is 2/3.

Problem:

Luna's family is planning a trip to Japan, and they want to stay in a traditional ryokan, a type of Japanese inn. The ryokan charges a daily rate of $150 per person, which includes breakfast and dinner. However, the family wants to save money, so they decide to share a room. The ryokan allows up to 4 people to share a room, and the cost per person decreases by 20% for each additional person in the room.

Step 1: Write an equation to represent the cost per person for 1, 2, 3, and 4 people sharing a room.

Let C represent the cost per person.

For 1 person: C = $150

For 2 people: C = $150 - (20% of $150) = $150 - $30 = $120

For 3 people: C = $150 - (20% of $150) - (20% of $120) = $150 - $30 - $24 = $96

For 4 people: C = $150 - (20% of $150) - (20% of $120) - (20% of $96) = $150 - $30 - $24 - $19.20 = $86.80

Step 2: Derive the formula for the sum of the cost per person for 1, 2, 3, and 4 people sharing a room.

The formula for the sum of a finite geometric series is:
S = a / (1 - r)

In this case, a = $150 (the cost per person for 1 person)
r = 0.20 (the discount percentage for each additional person)

S = $150 / (1 - 0.20) = $150 / 0.80 = $187.50

Step 3: Use the formula to calculate the total cost for Luna's family to stay in the ryokan for 4 nights.

The total cost for 4 nights = 4 x $187.50 = $750

Now, Luna's family wants to know how much they need to save each month to cover the cost of their trip. They plan to stay in the ryokan for 4 nights, and they want to save up the total cost of $750 in 6 months.

Step 4 (optional): Calculate the monthly savings needed to cover the cost of the trip.

To find the monthly savings, we can use the formula:
M = T / N

In this case, M = monthly savings
T = total cost = $750
N = number of months = 6

M = $750 / 6 = $125 per month

Therefore, Luna's family needs to save $125 per month for 6 months to cover the cost of their trip to Japan and stay in a traditional ryokan.

HS,"### Word Problem: The Festival Bracelet Stand

#### Background:
Maria is planning to sell handmade bracelets at a cultural festival. She wants to create a special deal to attract more customers. The deal involves selling the first bracelet at full price, but each subsequent bracelet will be sold at half the price of the previous bracelet. Maria wants to know how much she would make if she manages to sell the first 10 bracelets under these terms.

#### Problem Details:
1. The price of the first bracelet Maria sells is $10.
2. Each subsequent bracelet sold is priced at half the price of the previous bracelet.

#### Steps to Solve:

**Step 1: Understanding the Pricing Strategy**

If the first bracelet is sold at $10, what will be the price of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th bracelets? Calculate the price of each down to the 10th bracelet.

**Step 2: Determining the Formula**

Realize that the decreasing price of each bracelet forms a geometric sequence where:
- The first term \( a = 10 \) (Price of the first bracelet)
- The common ratio \( r = 0.5 \) (Each subsequent bracelet sells for half the price of the previous one)

The formula for the sum, \( S \), of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[
S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}
\]
You have to find \( S_{10} \), the sum of the first 10 terms.

**Step 3: Calculating the Earnings**

Plug in the values into the formula:
- Replace \( a \) with 10, \( r \) with 0.5, and \( n \) with 10.

Use these values to calculate Maria's potential earnings from selling the first 10 bracelets.

#### Make It Your Own:
You can adjust the price of the first bracelet, change the number of bracelets sold (i.e., change \( n \)), or modify the common ratio to explore different discount strategies (e.g., each subsequent bracelet sold at 75% of the previous' price implies \( r = 0.75 \)). 

This task allows students to engage in a realistic scenario related to commerce and culture, encourages mathematical application, and involves the derivation and use of an important algebraic formula.","Create a multi-step word problem aligned to HSA-SSE.B.4 with at least 3 steps to solve.

HS," Problem:

Jamal wants to save up for a new video game system that costs $350. He knows that he can save $30 each week from his allowance. However, he also wants to buy a new game every month, which costs $60. Can Jamal save enough money to buy the video game system and a new game within a year? If not, how much more money does he need to save?

Step 1: Write a geometric series for the amount of money Jamal saves each week for a year.

Let's assume that a year has 52 weeks. Since Jamal saves $30 each week, the amount of money he saves in a year can be represented as:

30 + 30(1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^51)

where r is the common ratio.

Step 2: Determine the common ratio and the sum of the geometric series.

The common ratio (r) is the ratio of the amount of money Jamal saves in consecutive weeks. Since Jamal saves $30 each week, the common ratio is 1.

To find the sum of the geometric series, we can use the formula:

Sum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where a is the first term, n is the number of terms, and r is the common ratio.

In this case, a = 30, n = 52, and r = 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Sum = 30 * (1 - 1^52) / (1 - 1)
Sum = 30 * (1 - 1) / (-1)
Sum = 30 * 1
Sum = 30

So, Jamal saves a total of $30 in a year.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the video game system and the new games.

The cost of the video game system is $350, and Jamal wants to buy a new game every month, which costs $60. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of the new games is:

12 * $60 = $720

Step 4: Determine if Jamal can save enough money to buy the video game system and a new game within a year.

The total cost of the video game system and the new games is $350 + $720 = $1070.

Since Jamal can only save $30 in a year, he cannot save enough money to buy the video game system and a new game within a year.

Step 5: Calculate how much more money Jamal needs to save.

The difference between the total cost and the amount of money Jamal saves is:

$1070 - $30 = $1040

Therefore, Jamal needs to save an additional $1040 to buy the video game system and a new game within a year.

Note: You can adjust the cost of the video game system, the amount of money Jamal saves each week, and the cost of the new games to make the problem more challenging or appropriate for different grade levels.","Create a multi-step word problem aligned to HSA-SSE.B.4 with at least 3 steps to solve.

Consider the polynomial \( f(x) = (x - 3)(x + 2) \).

1. Use the given factorization of the polynomial to find the zeros of \( f(x) \).
2. Plot these zeros on a number line.
3. Draw a rough graph of the polynomial \( f(x) \) using the zeros you have identified.

**Instructions for the Student:**

Step 1: *Finding the Zeros*  
You are given that \( f(x) = (x - 3)(x + 2) \). Zeros of the polynomial are values of \( x \) that make \( f(x) = 0 \). So, set each factor in the polynomial equal to 0 and solve for \( x \).

a. Set \( x - 3 = 0 \) and solve for \( x \).  
b. Set \( x + 2 = 0 \) and solve for \( x \).  

Write down the solutions; these are the zeros of the polynomial.

Step 2: *Plotting the Zeros*  
Once you find the zeros, plot them on a number line. Remember, a zero of the polynomial is a point where the graph of the polynomial will cross or touch the x-axis.

Step 3: *Drawing the Graph*  
Now, draw a rough sketch of the graph of the polynomial \( f(x) \):

- Start by marking the zeros identified in Step 1 on the x-axis of your graph.
- Since the polynomial \( f(x) = (x-3)(x+2) \) is a quadratic, its graph will be a parabola.
- Note the signs: 
  - The parabola opens upwards since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) (which is 1 in this case) is positive.
- Use your number line: between and outside your zeros, determine whether \( f(x) \) is positive or negative:
  - For \( x < -2 \), test a value like \( x =  -3 \) in the polynomial to see if \( f(x) \) is positive or negative.
  - For \(-2 < x < 3\), test a value like \( x = 0 \).
  - For \( x > 3 \), test a value like \( x = 4 \).

Sketch the graph based on these signs, making sure it passes through the zeros you plotted and reflects where the polynomial is positive or negative. Draw the shape of the parabola going through these points.

This simple process will help you visualize the polynomial and understand how its graph behaves with relation to its zeros.","Create a problem for HSA-APR.B.3. This problem will be for a special education resource student.

Problem:

Samantha is a high school student with a learning disability in math. She has been working hard to understand polynomials and their zeros. Her teacher has given her the following polynomial to find the zeros for:

f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 4

Samantha knows that she can factor this polynomial as (x + 2)^2, but she's having trouble visualizing the graph of the function. Can you help her find the zeros and create a rough graph of the function?

A) Find the zeros of f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 4.
B) Use the zeros to construct a rough graph of the function defined by the polynomial.

Solution:

A) To find the zeros of f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 4, we can set the polynomial equal to zero and solve for x:

x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0

We can factor the polynomial as (x + 2)^2 = 0:

(x + 2)^2 = 0

x + 2 = 0

x = -2

So, the only zero of f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 4 is x = -2.

B) To construct a rough graph of the function defined by the polynomial, we can start by plotting the point (−2, 0) on a coordinate plane. We know that the graph must pass through this point because f(−2) = 0.

Next, we can look at the signs of the coefficients of the polynomial. The leading coefficient (1) is positive, and the constant term (4) is positive. This tells us that the graph of the function will be a curve that opens upwards, like a parabola.

We can also see that the degree of the polynomial is 2, which means that the graph will have a maximum or minimum point. In this case, since the leading coefficient is positive, the graph will have a minimum point.

Using these observations, we can sketch a rough graph of the function, like this:

The graph has a minimum point at (−2, 0), and opens upwards, consistent with the signs of the coefficients.

Samantha can use this rough graph to get a sense of the shape of the function and how it behaves for different values of x. With practice, she'll become more comfortable visualizing polynomials and their zeros, and be able to graph them with greater accuracy.","Create a problem for HSA-APR.B.3.

Sarah is working on a project to design a triangular garden patch for her school's gardening club. The triangular garden patch is called a ""scalene triangle,"" meaning all sides are of different lengths. The measurements provided by Sarah are:

- One side of the triangle is 8 meters long.
- The adjacent angle to this side is 60 degrees.
- Another side of the triangle is 7 meters long.

Help Sarah find the length of the third side of the triangular garden patch using the Law of Cosines.

**Guide to Solution:**

To find the length of the third side, which we will call \( c \), we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines is stated as:
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C) \]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle and \( C \) is the angle opposite the side \( c \).

In this problem, let:
- \( a = 8 \) meters
- \( b = 7 \) meters
- \( C = 60 \) degrees

By substituting the values we have:
\[ c^2 = 8^2 + 7^2 - 2 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot \cos(60^\circ) \]

\[ c^2 = 64 + 49 - 2 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \]

\[ c = \sqrt{57} \approx 7.55 \] meters.

Therefore, the length of the third side of the triangular garden patch is approximately 7.55 meters.

Problem:

Tommy is a student who is visually impaired and has difficulty reading measurements on a ruler. He is trying to measure the length of a pencil using a braille ruler. The braille ruler has marks for every 5 centimeters. Tommy's teacher wants him to measure the pencil to the nearest centimeter.

Task:

1. Tommy's teacher gives him a pencil and asks him to measure its length using the braille ruler.
2. Tommy carefully runs his fingers over the braille marks on the ruler and reads the measurement.
3. Tommy reports the measurement to his teacher, but he is unsure if he read the measurement correctly.
4. The teacher checks Tommy's measurement and notices that he misread one of the braille marks.
5. The teacher asks Tommy to re-measure the pencil, this time using a different method.
6. Tommy uses a tape measure to measure the pencil and reports the measurement to his teacher.
7. The teacher checks Tommy's measurement and finds that it is accurate to the nearest centimeter.

HS,"### Problem Description:

Maria is helping set up for a school event and needs to measure the length and width of several tables to make sure they will fit in the assigned area of the school gym. She has a measuring tape but realizes that its smallest marking is in centimeters and not millimeters. 

The assigned area for setting the tables in the school gym is reported as precisely 8 meters long and 5 meters wide. Maria has four rectangular tables which she wants to arrange side by side along the length of the area. Each table measures approximately 2 meters in length and 1 meter in width. 

Maria needs to ensure the tables fit perfectly in the assigned space with a small margin for walking space between and around the tables.

### Question:

Given the limitations of Maria's measurement tool (centimeter accuracy), what is the most appropriate way for Maria to report the total length and width of the set-up tables, ensuring they fit within the given space? How should she consider the width of the spaces between the tables in her calculation?

### Solution Guidance:

Maria should first add up the lengths of the tables to see if they fit into the length of the assigned area. Since she is required to fit the tables within 8 meters:

- **Total length of the tables**: 4 tables × 2 meters/table = 8 meters

Since her measuring tape can measure accurately to the nearest centimeter, she should check if the combined length of the tables fits exactly inside the 8-meter limit or if she needs to adjust the space for walking between tables. If the tables, when pushed together, measure exactly or slightly less than 8 meters, she should space them a little apart.

For the width, since each table has a width of 1 meter:

- **Total width of the tables side by side**: 1 meter (since they are not placed side by side by their width, but along their length for this setup)

Given that the total width of the assigned space is 5 meters, she realizes she has ample space for arranging these tables and providing reasonable walking space on the sides.

Therefore, Maria should report:
- **Length setup**: Each table's length is approximately 2 meters. With four tables, the total approximates to 8 meters. She needs to consider a slight margin, and therefore she might claim each is ""approximately 2 meters with slight gaps for a total of about 8 meters allowed by space constraints.""
- **Width setup**: As the tables are aligned lengthwise, the width taken up is about 1 meter with ample space around for maneuvering.

This report considers the accuracy limitation of her measurement tool (centimeters) and allows small deviations around the 8-meter constraint for practical setup and ease of movement.","Create a problem for HSN-Q.A.3. This problem will be for a special education resource student.

HS," Question:

Solve the following radical equation: $\sqrt{2x-3}+5=8$

A) 7
B) 8
C) 9
D) 10

Explanation:

To solve the equation, first isolate the square root term:

$\sqrt{2x-3}=8-5$
$\sqrt{2x-3}=3$

Next, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

$2x-3=3^2$
$2x-3=9$

Then, add 3 to both sides to solve for x:

$2x=12$
$x=6$

However, this solution must be checked because squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions. Substituting x=6 back into the original equation, we get:

$\sqrt{2(6)-3}+5=\sqrt{12-3}+5=\sqrt{9}+5=3+5=8$

Since this result is consistent with the original equation, x=6 is a valid solution. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 7.","please generate a possible quiz item aligned to common core SS for Math for HSA-REI.A.2

Solve the radical equation below and determine if there are any extraneous solutions.

**Answer Choices:**
A) x = 6 (extraneous)
B) x = 3
C) x = 4 (extraneous)
D) No solution

**Correct Answer:**

D) No solution

**Solution Process:**

1. Start by isolating the radical: √(x + 6) = x - 2.
2. Square both sides to eliminate the radical:
   (√(x + 6))^2 = (x - 2)^2
   x + 6 = x^2 - 4x + 4

3. Rearrange the equation to set it to zero:
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - x - 6 = 0
   x^2 - 5x - 2 = 0

4. Factor the quadratic equation:
   (x - 5)(x + 1) = 0

5. Solve for x:
   x - 5 = 0 ⇒ x = 5
   x + 1 = 0 ⇒ x = -1

6. Check for extraneous solutions by substituting back into the original equation:

   For x = 5:
   √(5 + 6) = 5 - 2

   (x = 5 is extraneous)

   For x = -1:

(2x + 3) / (x + 1) = 4

A) x = 2
B) x = -1
C) x = 1/2
D) x = 3/2

 Solution:

First, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by the least common denominator (LCD) of the fractions, which is 2:

(2x + 3) / (x + 1) = 4

(2x + 3) \* 2 / (x + 1) \* 2 = 8

4x + 6 = 8

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 6 from both sides:

4x = 2

x = 2/4

x = 1/2

Therefore, the correct answer is C) x = 1/2.

#### Problem Statement:

The table below shows the total number of trees planted by a community group over a five-day period.

| Day | Trees Planted |
|-----|---------------|
| 1   | 50            |
| 2   | 70            |
| 3   | 90            |
| 4   | 100           |
| 5   | 120           |

1. Calculate the average rate of change of the number of trees planted from Day 2 to Day 4.
2. Interpret the average rate of change calculated in part 1.

#### Solution Process:

1. **Calculate the Average Rate of Change:**
   The average rate of change of a function can be calculated using the formula:
   
   \[
   \text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{\text{Change in output}}{\text{Change in input}} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
   \]

   In this case, let’s calculate the average rate of change from Day 2 to Day 4.
   - Input \(a = 2\) (Day 2) and output \(f(a) = 70\) (trees planted on Day 2).
   - Input \(b = 4\) (Day 4) and output \(f(b) = 100\) (trees planted on Day 4).

   Substituting these values in the above formula gives:

   \[
   \text{Average Rate of Change from Day 2 to Day 4} = \frac{100 - 70}{4 - 2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

   Thus, the average rate of change of the trees planted from Day 2 to Day 4 is 15 trees per day.

2. **Interpretation of the Result:**
   The average rate of change of 15 trees per day from Day 2 to Day 4 means that on average, the number of trees planted increased by 15 trees each day over this interval. This reflects a consistent growth in the number of trees being planted each day within the given days.","Please generate a practice problem aligned to HSF-IF.B.6.

#### Problem Statement:
You are given a triangle ABC, where DE is a line segment parallel to side BC and DE intersects side AB at point D and side AC at point E. Show that the line segment DE divides the other two sides proportionally, i.e., prove that $\frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{AE}{EC}$.

#### Diagram:
- Start by sketching triangle ABC.
- Draw line segment DE parallel to side BC, intersecting AB at D and AC at E.

#### Proof Steps:
1. **Draw the Triangle and Line Segment**: Sketch triangle ABC. Draw line DE parallel to side BC, intersecting AB at D and AC at E.

2. **State Given Information and What Needs to Be Proven**:
   - Given:
     - Triangle ABC.
     - Line segment DE parallel to BC.
   - To prove: $\frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{AE}{EC}$.

3. **Invoke the Basic Proportional Theorem (Thales' Theorem)**:
   - Since DE is parallel to BC and is a transversal through triangle ABC, it creates two smaller triangles, ADE and DEC, which are similar to the larger triangle ABC by the basic proportionality (Thales') theorem.

4. **Establish Proportional Relationships**:
   - From triangle similarity:
     - $\triangle ADE \sim \triangle ABC$ (Angle-Angle similarity: corresponding angles created by the parallel line DE and line BC)
     - $\triangle DEC \sim \triangle ABC$ (Similar argument as above)

5. **Write Proportions from Similar Triangles**:
   - From $\triangle ADE \sim \triangle ABC$, corresponding sides are proportional:
     - $\frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AE}{AC} = \frac{DE}{BC}$
   - From $\triangle DEC \sim \triangle ABC$, corresponding sides are proportional:
     - $\frac{DE}{BC} = \frac{EC}{AC} = \frac{DC}{AB}$

6. **Relate the Proportions to Solve**:
   - $\frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AE}{AC}$, and since $AB = AD + DB$ and $AC = AE + EC$, we can rewrite these as:
     - $\frac{AD}{AD + DB} = \frac{AE}{AE + EC}$
   - Solving for $\frac{AD}{DB}$ in terms of AE and EC:
     - $\frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{\frac{AD}{AB}}{\frac{DB}{AB}} = \frac{\frac{AE}{AC}}{\frac{EC}{AC}} = \frac{AE}{EC}$.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, by proving the similarity of triangles and establishing these proportional segments, we have shown that $\frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{AE}{EC}$ as was required.

In triangle ABC, angle A is a right angle, AB = 12 cm, and AC = 9 cm. Draw an auxiliary line from point B perpendicular to side AC, intersecting AC at point D. Calculate the area of triangle ABC using the formula A = 1/2 ab sin(C).

Solution:
Since angle A is a right angle, angle C is the angle between sides AB and AC. The length of side BC is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. We can use the sine function to find the length of side BD, which is the height of triangle ABC:

sin(C) = (opposite side) / (hypotenuse)
sin(C) = BD / AC
sin(C) = BD / 9

Now, we can solve for BD:

BD = 9 * sin(C)

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle:

A = 1/2 ab sin(C)
A = 1/2 (AB)(BD)
A = 1/2 (12)(9 * sin(C))

Since we are given the measures of sides AB and AC, we can find the measure of angle C using the cosine function:

cos(C) = (adjacent side) / (hypotenuse)
cos(C) = AB / BC
cos(C) = 12 / √(AB^2 + AC^2)

Now, we can solve for angle C:

C = arccos(cos(C))
C = arccos(12 / √(12^2 + 9^2))
C ≈ 0.6435 radians or 36.87 degrees

Now, we can find the area of triangle ABC:

HS,"### Practice Problem: Explorations in Rational and Irrational Numbers

**Problem:**

Given the numbers \(a = \frac{5}{6}\), \(b = \sqrt{2}\), and \(c = \frac{3}{4}\):

1. Calculate \(a + c\) and determine whether the result is rational or irrational.
2. Calculate \(a + b\) and determine whether the result is rational or irrational.
3. Calculate \(a \cdot b\) and determine whether the result is rational or irrational.
4. Calculate \(b \cdot c\) and determine whether the result is rational or irrational.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Sum of \(a\) and \(c\) (\(\frac{5}{6} + \frac{3}{4}\))**:
   - Find a common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{5}{6} = \frac{5 \times 4}{6 \times 4} = \frac{20}{24}, \quad \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 6}{4 \times 6} = \frac{18}{24}
     \]
   - Add the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{20}{24} + \frac{18}{24} = \frac{38}{24} = \frac{19}{12}
     \]
   - **Result:** The sum \( \frac{19}{12} \) is a rational number, since it can be expressed as a ratio of two integers.

2. **Sum of \(a\) and \(b\) (\(\frac{5}{6} + \sqrt{2}\))**:
   - This sum combines a rational number, \(\frac{5}{6}\), with an irrational number, \(\sqrt{2}\).
   - **Result:** According to HSN-RN.B.3, the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational. Therefore, \(\frac{5}{6} + \sqrt{2}\) is irrational.

3. **Product of \(a\) and \(b\) (\(\frac{5}{6} \cdot \sqrt{2}\))**:
   - Multiply the rational number \(\frac{5}{6}\) with the irrational number \(\sqrt{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{5}{6} \cdot \sqrt{2} = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{6}
     \]
   - **Result:** Since \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational, and multiplying by a nonzero rational number \(\frac{5}{6}\), the product remains irrational. Thus, \(\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{6}\) is irrational.

4. **Product of \(b\) and \(c\) (\(\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4}\))**:
   - Multiply the irrational number \(\sqrt{2}\) with a rational number \(\frac{3}{4}\):
     \[
     \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4}
     \]
   - **Result:** The product of a nonzero rational number \(\frac{3}{4}\) and an irrational number \(\sqrt{2}\) results in an irrational number. Thus, \(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4}\) is irrational.

HS," Problem:

Explain why the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is always an irrational number. Give an example to support your explanation.

Explanation:

A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction p/q of two integers, where the denominator q is not equal to zero. An irrational number, on the other hand, is a number that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction and has an infinite, non-repeating decimal expansion.

When we add a rational number to an irrational number, the sum is always an irrational number. This is because the irrational number cannot be written as a fraction, and so the sum cannot be simplified to a rational number.

For example, let's take the rational number 2 and the irrational number √2. The sum of these two numbers is 2 + √2, which cannot be expressed as a fraction and has an infinite, non-repeating decimal expansion. Therefore, the sum is an irrational number.","Please generate a practice problem aligned to HSN-RN.B.3.

1. The sum of two rational numbers is rational because it can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. In this case, (2/3) and (1/4) are both rational, so their sum (7/12) is also rational.
2. The product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational. In this case, (1/2) is a nonzero rational number, and √2 is an irrational number, so their product (0.7071...) is irrational.

#### Context:
Sophia has started a small business where she makes and sells handcrafted jewelry. Her revenue from selling necklaces is given by the expression \( R(n) = 15n \), where \( n \) represents the number of necklaces sold.

#### Problem:
1. Explain what the expression \( R(n) = 15n \) represents in the context of Sophia's business.
2. If Sophia managed to sell 50 necklaces, calculate her total revenue. 
3. Sophia wants to know how many necklaces she needs to sell to earn $600. Solve this by setting up an equation and finding the value of \( n \).

#### Follow-Up Questions:
4. If Sophia decides to increase the price of each necklace by $5, how would the expression for the revenue change?
5. Considering the new price, calculate the new revenue if she sells the same amount of necklaces as in question 2.

### Answers:

1. The expression \( R(n) = 15n \) represents the total revenue Sophia earns from her business, where \( n \) is the number of necklaces sold, and each necklace is sold at a price of $15.

2. To find the total revenue for selling 50 necklaces, substitute \( n = 50 \) into the expression:
   \[ R(50) = 15 \times 50 = 750 \]
   Sophia’s total revenue from selling 50 necklaces is $750.

3. To find out how many necklaces need to be sold to have a revenue of $600, set up the equation:
   \[ 15n = 600 \]
   Solving for \( n \):
   \[ n = \frac{600}{15} = 40 \]
   Sophia needs to sell 40 necklaces to earn $600.

4. If Sophia increases the price of each necklace by $5, the new price of each necklace would be $20. Therefore, the new revenue expression in terms of \( n \) would be \( R_{new}(n) = 20n \).

5. Using the new expression for the adjusted price:
   \[ R_{new}(50) = 20 \times 50 = 1000 \]
   With the price increase, selling 50 necklaces would bring Sophia a revenue of $1000.

HS,"### Practice Task: Experimenting with Transformations of Functions

#### Objective:
To understand how the graph of a function \( f(x) \) changes when the function is modified to \( f(x) + k \), \( k f(x) \), \( f(kx) \), and \( f(x + k) \), and to recognize even and odd functions based on their graphs and algebraic expressions.

#### Task Description:
You will investigate the transformations of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \), a simple quadratic function, with different values of \( k \). You will then use graphing technology to visualize these transformations and discuss the effects. Furthermore, recognize if the resulting function is even or odd.

#### Instructions:

1. **Graph the Original Function:**
   - Start by graphing the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) using a graphing calculator or graphing software. Label this graph.

2. **Transformation 1: Vertical Shift (Addition/Subtraction)**
   - Choose a positive value for \( k \) (e.g., \( k = 3 \)) and graph \( f(x) + k = x^2 + 3 \).
   - Now, choose a negative value for \( k \) (e.g., \( k = -2 \)) and graph \( f(x) + k = x^2 - 2 \).
   - Describe how the graph changes with these transformations.

3. **Transformation 2: Stretching or Compressing (Multiplication)**
   - Choose a positive value for \( k \) greater than 1 (e.g., \( k = 2 \)) and graph \( k f(x) = 2x^2 \).
   - Choose a positive value for \( k \) less than 1 (e.g., \( k = 0.5 \)) and graph \( k f(x) = 0.5x^2 \).
   - Describe how the graph changes with these transformations.

4. **Transformation 3: Horizontal Scaling**
   - Choose a positive value for \( k \) greater than 1 (e.g., \( k = 2 \)) and graph \( f(kx) = (2x)^2 \).
   - Choose a positive value for \( k \) less than 1 (e.g., \( k = 0.5 \)) and graph \( f(kx) = (0.5x)^2 \).
   - Describe how the graph changes with these transformations.
   
5. **Transformation 4: Horizontal Shift (Addition/Subtraction)**
   - Choose a positive value for \( k \) (e.g., \( k = 3 \)) and graph \( f(x+k) = (x+3)^2 \).
   - Choose a negative value for \( k \) (e.g., \( k = -2 \)) and graph \( f(x+k) = (x-2)^2 \).
   - Describe how the graph changes with these transformations.

6. **Even and Odd Functions Recognition:**
   - Based on the transformed graphs and the original function, determine which transformations result in even functions or odd functions.
   - Provide the algebraic proof or reasoning behind your conclusion.

#### Questions for Analysis:
- Compare the effects of adding/subtracting \( k \) to \( f(x) \) versus multiplying \( x \) by \( k \). How do these transformations differ in terms of their impact on the graph?
- What happens to the vertex of the graph for each type of transformation?
- How do the changes in the graph help in identifying a function as even or odd?

**Problem:**

Consider quadrilateral ABCD inscribed in a circle, with points A, B, C, and D lying on the circle.

**Task:**

1. **Draw** the figure described above. Label all points and the circle.
2. **Prove** that opposite angles in an inscribed quadrilateral are supplementary (i.e., their sum is 180 degrees).

**Hints:**
- Recall that an angle inscribed in a circle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
- Remember to consider the entire 360 degrees of the circle when thinking about how the arcs relate to each other.

**Solution Steps Outline:**

a. Identify the arcs intercepted by angles ∠ABC and ∠ADC.
b. Express the measures of these angles in terms of the intercepted arcs.
c. Use the properties of a circle and the relationships between the arcs and angles.

**Expected Student Response:**

1. **Drawing:**
   - Draw circle O.
   - Place points A, B, C, D on the circumference such that they form quadrilateral ABCD.

2. **Proof:**
   - ∠ABC and ∠ADC are opposite angles.
   - Let arc AC be the arc intercepted by ∠ABC and arc BD be the arc intercepted by ∠ADC.
   - Since angle ∠ABC is inscribed, it measures half the arc AC, so ∠ABC = 1/2 arc AC.
   - Similarly, ∠ADC = 1/2 arc BD.
   - The arcs AC and BD are together 360° since they encompass the whole circle.
   - Therefore, 1/2 arc AC + 1/2 arc BD = 1/2 (arc AC + arc BD) = 1/2 × 360° = 180°.
   - Hence, ∠ABC + ∠ADC = 180°, showing that opposite angles in the inscribed quadrilateral are supplementary.

Item:

In the diagram below, △ABC is congruent to △DEF.

Use the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions to explain why △ABC is congruent to △DEF.

[Insert diagram of △ABC and △DEF]

In your response, be sure to:

* Identify the type of congruence (ASA, SAS, or SSS) that applies to the given triangles.
* Explain how the criteria for the identified type of congruence follow from the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions.
* Use geometric vocabulary and notation to support your explanation.

Possible solution:

The triangles △ABC and △DEF are congruent by SAS (Side-Angle-Side).

According to the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions, two figures are congruent if and only if there exists a rigid motion that maps one figure onto the other. In the case of △ABC and △DEF, we can observe that there is a rotation that maps △ABC onto △DEF. Specifically, if we rotate △ABC counterclockwise by 90 degrees around the midpoint of side AB, we obtain △DEF.

The rotation that maps △ABC onto △DEF is a rigid motion, meaning that it preserves both distance and angles. Therefore, the corresponding sides and angles of the two triangles are congruent. Specifically, we have:

* AB = DE (corresponding sides)
* BC = EF (corresponding sides)
* AC = DF (corresponding sides)
* ∠A = ∠D (corresponding angles)
* ∠B = ∠E (corresponding angles)
* ∠C = ∠F (corresponding angles)

Since we have established that all three pairs of corresponding sides and all three pairs of corresponding angles are congruent, we can conclude that △ABC is congruent to △DEF by SAS.

Therefore, the criteria for SAS congruence (i.e., all three pairs of corresponding sides and all three pairs of corresponding angles are congruent) follow directly from the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions.","Please generate an item aligned to CCSS math HSG-CO.B.8 for students to use to practice with.

A bag contains 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 3 green balls. If a ball is drawn at random from the bag, what is the probability that it is blue or green?

A) 1/2
B) 2/3
C) 3/5
D) 7/10

Solution:

There are a total of 5 + 7 + 3 = 15 balls in the bag.

The number of blue balls is 7. The number of green balls is 3.

The probability of drawing a blue ball is 7/15. The probability of drawing a green ball is 3/15.

The probability that the ball drawn is blue or green is the sum of the probabilities of drawing a blue ball and a green ball:

P(blue or green) = P(blue) + P(green)
= 7/15 + 3/15
= 10/15

**Problem:**
In a deck of 52 cards, consisting of 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades), each suit contains 13 cards ranging from Ace to King. David is planning a card trick in which he needs to ensure he has one card from each of the four suits. He decides to pick 10 random cards from the deck. What is the probability that he will have at least one card from each suit among the 10 cards he picks?

**Instructions:**
To solve this problem, follow the steps below. Use permutations and combinations to compute the probabilities and avoid or account for the overlap of probabilities using the Inclusion-Exclusion principle.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 10 cards from 52 cards.**  
This is done using combinations since the order of selecting cards does not matter. 

**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 10 cards such that one or more suits are missing.**  
- Calculate the number of ways to choose 10 cards with all selections missing at least one specific suit.
    - Cases to consider:
        - Missing hearts: choose all 10 cards from the remaining 39 cards (diamonds, clubs, and spades).
        - Missing diamonds: choose all 10 cards from the other 39 cards (hearts, clubs, and spades).
        - Missing clubs or spades similarly.
- Utilize the Inclusion-Exclusion principle to correct for over-counting when more than one suit is missing.

**Step 3: Subtract the combinations calculated in Step 2 from those in Step 1 to find the number of desirable outcomes (having at least one card from each suit).**

**Step 4: Compute the probability by dividing the result of Step 3 by the result of Step 1.**

Your final answer should be expressed as a fraction simplified to the lowest terms or as a decimal.

A bag contains 5 red balls, 7 blue balls, and 3 green balls. A ball is drawn at random from the bag, and then, without replacing the first ball, a second ball is drawn.

a) What is the probability that both balls drawn are red?
b) What is the probability that the first ball drawn is blue and the second ball drawn is not blue?

To solve these problems, students will need to use permutations and combinations to compute probabilities of compound events.

Answer key:

a) To find the probability that both balls drawn are red, we need to find the probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw and then drawing a red ball on the second draw. The probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw is 5/15 (since there are 5 red balls and 15 balls in total). After drawing one red ball, there are now 4 red balls and 14 balls in total. So, the probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw is 4/14. Therefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is (5/15) x (4/14) = 2/21.

b) To find the probability that the first ball drawn is blue and the second ball drawn is not blue, we need to find the probability of drawing a blue ball on the first draw and then drawing a ball that is not blue on the second draw. The probability of drawing a blue ball on the first draw is 7/15 (since there are 7 blue balls and 15 balls in total). After drawing one blue ball, there are now 14 balls in total. So, the probability of drawing a ball that is not blue on the second draw is 12/14 (since there are 12 non-blue balls and 14 balls in total). Therefore, the probability that the first ball drawn is blue and the second ball drawn is not blue is (7/15) x (12/14) = 4/15.","Please generate an item aligned to CCSS math HSS-CP.B.9 for students to use to practice with.

**Context & Problem:**

The United Nations has decided to sponsor a series of monuments around the globe to celebrate world unity and diversity. Each monument is designed to reflect elements significant to the culture and history of its location. You, as an expert in geometry, have been asked to participate in the project by evaluating the designs - which include circles and various three-dimensional shapes - to ensure mathematical accuracy in their dimensions.

**Part 1: Circumference and Area of a Circle**

A circular monument planned in Nairobi, Kenya intends to symbolize unity. The architect envisions a bronze circle with a radius of 7 meters. 

a) Provide an informal argument to explain why the formula for the circumference of this circle (C=2πr) accurately calculates its length around.
   
b) Discuss briefly how the area formula (A=πr^2) is derived and compute the area of the circle.

**Part 2: Volume of a Cylinder**

In Tokyo, Japan, a cylindrical water fountain is proposed to celebrate peace. The fountain has a circular base with a radius of 3 meters and a height of 10 meters.

a) Use Cavalieri’s principle to argue why the formula for the volume of this cylinder (V=πr^2h) is valid.

**Part 3: Volume of a Pyramid**

For Cairo, Egypt, planners wish to echo the heritage of the Pyramids at Giza through a smaller, modern granite pyramid with a square base side length 14 meters and a height of 9 meters.

a) Give an informal argument using dissection that explains why the volume formula for a pyramid (V=1/3Bh, where B is the area of the base and h is the height) works for this structure.

**Part 4: Volume of a Cone**

Lastly, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a celebration of local nature is captured in a giant cone-shaped monument, derived from the shapes of the surrounding mountains, made from local stone. The cone has a base radius of 5 meters and a height of 15 meters.

a) Describe using an informal limit argument why the formula for the volume of a cone (V=1/3πr^2h) correctly calculates the volume of this cone.

Problem: ""Exploring Cultural Connections Through Geometric Shapes""

In this problem, you will use geometric shapes to explore cultural connections and informal arguments to justify formulas. Choose a cultural object or structure that interests you, such as a traditional dwelling, a piece of artwork, or a symbolic monument.

Task:

1. Identify the geometric shapes that are present in your chosen cultural object or structure. These might include circles, triangles, squares, rectangles, cylinders, pyramids, or cones.
2. Use dissection arguments, Cavalieri’s principle, and informal limit arguments to give an informal argument for the formulas of the circumference of a circle, area of a circle, volume of a cylinder, pyramid, and cone. Consider how these formulas might be applied to your chosen cultural object or structure.
3. Create a visual representation of your chosen cultural object or structure using geometric shapes. This might be a drawing, a 3D model, or a digital rendering. Be sure to label the geometric shapes that you have identified.
4. Write a short reflection (1-2 paragraphs) that describes the cultural significance of your chosen object or structure and how it relates to the geometric shapes you have identified. Consider how the shapes contribute to the overall meaning or purpose of the object or structure.

Example:

A student chooses a traditional Native American teepee as their cultural object. They identify the following geometric shapes in the teepee's design:

* Circles (the base of the teepee and the smoke hole at the top)
* Triangles (the support poles and the roof)
* Rectangles (the entrance flap and the sides of the teepee)

The student uses dissection arguments to informally argue for the formula of the circumference of a circle (C = 2πr) by cutting the circle into smaller pieces and rearranging them to form a rectangle. They use Cavalieri’s principle to argue for the formula of the area of a circle (A = πr^2) by considering the total area of the triangles that make up the roof of the teepee.

For the volume of a cylinder (V = πr^2h), the student considers the height of the teepee and the area of the base, which is a circle. They use an informal limit argument to justify the formula, considering the volume of the teepee as the limit of the sum of the volumes of the small rectangles that make up the sides.

Finally, the student creates a visual representation of the teepee using geometric shapes and labels each shape. They write a reflection that describes the cultural significance of the teepee and how the geometric shapes contribute to its meaning and purpose. They discuss how the circular base and smoke hole represent the connection to the earth and the sky, while the triangular support poles represent the three sacred virtues of the Native American culture: respect, courage, and honesty.

HS,"### Practice Item: Cultural Awareness Survey Analysis

#### Scenario
To celebrate the diversity in your class, the school has conducted a cultural awareness survey among the students. The survey asked each student to name a festival or celebration significant to their culture or family and explain its importance. The collected data serves as a random sample of the school’s multicultural identity.

You are provided with the responses from the survey, which outline various festivals and their significance. Assume we have 100 survey responses from students of different cultural backgrounds. 

#### Task
You are tasked with analyzing this random sample to infer the most popular types of celebrations and their cultural significance across the broader school population. 

#### Data Sample (Extracted Responses)

1. Diwali – ""Festival of Lights, important for family gatherings and celebrating the triumph of light over darkness.""
2. Lunar New Year – ""Time to honor ancestors and get together with family.""
3. Eid al-Fitr – ""Celebration at the end of Ramadan, marking a period of joy after fasting.""
4. Thanksgiving – ""Focuses on giving thanks, especially in a familial setting.""
5. Carnival – ""Represents freedom and fun before Lent; varies significantly across cultures.""
6. Hanukkah – ""Festival of Lights, celebrating religious freedom and miracles.""
7. Day of the Dead – ""Honors deceased ancestors, focusing on remembrance and respect.""

#### Questions
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: What percentage of the sampled students celebrates a ""Festival of Lights""? Consider Diwali and Hanukkah for your analysis.

2. **Inference**: Based on the sample, estimate the percentage of the whole student population that places a significant emphasis on family gatherings during their cultural celebrations. Use your judgement to decide which festivals fall into this category from the provided responses.

3. **Comparison**: Which celebration type (religious, ancestral, or general festivity) is represented the most in the sample? What might this imply about the cultural makeup of the school population?

4. **Cultural Significance**: Discuss how understanding the popular celebrations within a diverse school environment can aid in promoting multicultural awareness and inclusivity. How might the school use this information?

#### Guidance for Answering
- Calculate the percentages based on the number of mentions in the survey responses.
- Apply statistical reasoning to estimate broader trends from the sample data.
- Use critical thinking to connect cultural practices with their roles in promoting a diverse and inclusive school community.

Item Title: ""Inferring About Diverse Populations""

Item Description:

Ms. Johnson's class is a diverse group of students from different racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. As part of their math project, they want to estimate the average amount of time spent on homework per night by students in their class. They decide to take a random sample of 25 students from their class and record the time spent on homework per night for each student.

The data they collect is represented in the table below:

| Student ID | Time Spent on Homework per Night (minutes) |

Question:

What is the estimated average amount of time spent on homework per night by students in Ms. Johnson's class?

A) 45 minutes
B) 55 minutes
C) 60 minutes
D) 70 minutes

Rationale:

This item is culturally competent because it recognizes and values the diversity of the students in Ms. Johnson's class. By using a random sample of students from different racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds, the item acknowledges that the population of students is diverse and that the sample should reflect this diversity. The item also assumes that the students in the class have different family structures, languages, and nationalities, and it does not make any assumptions about their backgrounds or experiences.

The item also addresses the standard HSS-IC.A.1 by asking students to make inferences about the population parameter (the average amount of time spent on homework per night by students in Ms. Johnson's class) based on a random sample from that population. The item requires students to apply statistical concepts, such as sample mean, to solve a real-world problem that is relevant to their lives.

By including diverse characters and contexts in the item, it promotes inclusivity and equity for all students, regardless of their backgrounds. This helps to ensure that all students have equal opportunities to learn and demonstrate their understanding of statistical concepts.","my math class is very diverse, with many nationalities, races, languages, and genders represented along with diverse familiy structures.

**Practice Item: Global Tea Consumption**

In different countries, tea is consumed at varying rates per person annually. Let's explore this globally relevant topic!

#### Task:
A table below shows the annual tea consumption per capita in four countries represented in kilograms.

| Country  | Tea Consumption per Capita (kg) |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Japan    | 1.2                            |
| Turkey   | 3.5                            |

| England  | 2.3                            |

Imagine an organization is conducting a study on tea consumption patterns and how they correlate with the number of tea-related cultural events in these countries. The organization hypothesizes that the more tea a population consumes per capita, the more tea-related cultural events take place in that country.

#### Instructions:
1. **Write a function f(x) that expresses the number of tea-related cultural events, y, based on the tea consumption per capita, x.** Assume a simple linear relationship for this model: \( y = ax + b \) where:
   - a = 2 (suggesting every kilogram of tea per capita results in two major tea-related events annually),
   - b = 0 (indicating that there are no tea-related events in a country with no tea consumption per capita).

2. **Calculate the predicted number of tea-related cultural events in each of the countries using your function.**

#### Questions:
- Which country would potentially hold the highest number of tea-related cultural events according to this function? Why?
- Explain how cultural influences in each country might affect both tea consumption and the frequency of related cultural events.

#### Scenario: The Community Mural Festival

**Step 1: Gathering Shapes for the Mural**  
Ms. Lee, a local artist, is organizing a mural festival in the park. She wants to make the festival fun and educational for kids by creating a giant mural made of colorful shapes. She has planned to use triangles, circles, and squares. Ms. Lee asks you to help her gather the shapes.

**Problem 1:** Ms. Lee already has 4 triangles and 3 circles. She needs at least 10 shapes in total to start the mural. How many more shapes does she need?  

**Step 2: Sorting the Shapes**  
Once you have the total shapes, Ms. Lee needs them sorted so they can be used effectively. She decides to have an equal number of each shape to make the mural balanced and harmonious.

**Problem 2:** If Ms. Lee wants the same number of triangles, circles, and squares, and you already have 4 triangles and 3 circles, how many squares should you bring, and how many additional triangles and circles are needed to have equal numbers of each shape?  

**Step 3: Designing the Mural Section**  
Ms. Lee gives you a special task to create a small section of the mural on a rectangular poster board that she will display at the entrance. She wants each type of shape to be used at least twice in your design.

**Problem 3:** How will you arrange the triangles, circles, and squares on the poster board? Try to make a sketch where each shape is used at least twice. Can you name each shape clearly and correctly even if they might look different based on their sizes and how they're turned?

*Note for Teachers/Parents: You can ask students to actually draw this on paper for a hands-on activity!*

Problem:

Step 1:
Afua is planning a cultural festival for her community. She wants to create a logo for the festival that represents the diversity of cultures coming together. She decides to use a combination of shapes to create the logo. She chooses a hexagon, a circle, and a triangle.

Step 2:
Afua wants the logo to be symmetrical, so she decides to mirror the shapes across a vertical line. She draws a line down the center of the logo and reflects the shapes across it. The hexagon becomes two triangles, the circle becomes a half-circle, and the triangle becomes a smaller triangle.

Step 3:
Afua realizes that the smaller triangle is not visible enough, so she decides to enlarge it. She scales up the triangle by a factor of 2, making it twice as big. Now, the triangle is visible and balances out the other shapes in the logo.

Step 4 (optional):
Afua wants to add some color to the logo. She decides to use colors that are significant to the cultures represented in the festival. She chooses red for passion and energy, blue for peace and unity, and yellow for happiness and celebration. She assigns a different color to each shape, making sure that the colors complement each other and create a visually appealing logo.

Question:
What is the name of the shape that Afua enlarged in step 3?

Answer:
The shape that Afua enlarged in step 3 is a triangle.

This problem aligns with K.G.A.2 because it requires students to correctly name shapes (triangles, hexagons, circles) regardless of their orientations (mirrored across a vertical line) or overall size (enlarged). The problem also incorporates real-life context and cultural relevance, making it engaging and meaningful for students who are interested in culturally responsive scenarios.

You can adjust the problem by changing the shapes, colors, and context to better suit your students' needs and interests. For example, you could replace the hexagon with a square or a rhombus, or change the colors to reflect different cultural significance.

K,"Title: Jamal’s Birthday Party Balloons

**Background:**
Jamal is having a big birthday party to celebrate his 7th birthday! For the party, he decided he wanted to decorate with his favorite multicolored balloons. Each pack contains 10 balloons, but he wants to make sure he has a total of 19 balloons to cover his backyard.

**Step 1:** Jamal already bought 1 pack of 10 balloons. How many more balloons does he need to reach his goal of 19 balloons?

**Problem Solving:**
First, represent the 10 balloons Jamal already has. We know he wants 19 balloons in total. 
So, the equation looks like this:
\( 10 + \text{more balloons} = 19 \).
Let’s find out how many more balloons are needed. 

**Step 2:** Jamal’s mom gave him $10 to buy more balloons. Each additional balloon costs $1. With $10, how many more balloons can he buy? Is it enough according to step 1?

**Problem Solving:**
He calculates how many more balloons he can buy with $10. Since each costs $1, he can buy 10 additional balloons, making the math simple: 
\( \$10 \div \$1 = 10 \text{ balloons} \).
Now, compare this to the number needed we found in step 1.

**Step 3:** Jamal decided to buy 9 more balloons, saving $1. With 10 balloons from his first pack and 9 more new balloons, how many does he have now? Does it meet his goal of 19 balloons?

**Problem Solving:**
Now we add the first pack of balloons to the additional ones he bought:
\( 10 \text{ balloons (from the first pack)} + 9 \text{ balloons (new)} \).
Let's add:
\( 10 + 9 = 19 \text{ balloons} \).

**Conclusion:**
Did Jamal meet his goal? Have kids verify the total number of balloons Jamal has now and see if it matches his target number of 19. This problem combines counting, addition, subtraction, and basic money skills while contextualizing it in a fun, familiar setting. Adjust the total balloons, number in each pack, or balloon cost to match different levels or variations of the problem!","Create a multi-step word problem aligned to K.NBT.A.1 with at least 3 steps to solve.
